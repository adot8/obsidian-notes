Numerous organizations leverage virtualization platforms such as Terminal Services, Citrix, AWS AppStream, CyberArk PSM and Kiosk to offer remote access solutions in order to meet their business requirements. However, in most organizations "lock-down" measures are implemented in their desktop environments to minimize the potential impact of malicious staff members and compromised accounts on overall domain security. While these desktop restrictions can impede threat actors, there remains a possibility for them to "break-out" of the restricted environment.

Basic Methodology for break-out:

1. Gain access to a `Dialog Box`.
2. Exploit the Dialog Box to achieve `command execution`.
3. `Escalate privileges` to gain higher levels of access.
