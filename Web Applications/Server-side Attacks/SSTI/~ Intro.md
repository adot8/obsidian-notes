Web applications can utilize templating engines and server-side templates to generate responses such as HTML content dynamically. This generation is often based on user input, enabling the web application to respond to user input dynamically. When an attacker can inject template code, a [Server-Side Template Injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/18-Testing_for_Server_Side_Template_Injection) vulnerability can occur. SSTI can lead to various security risks, including data leakage and even full server compromise via remote code execution.
