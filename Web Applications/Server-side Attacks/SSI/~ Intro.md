Similar to server-side templates, server-side includes (SSI) can be used to generate HTML responses dynamically. SSI directives instruct the webserver to include additional content dynamically. These directives are embedded into HTML files. For instance, SSI can be used to include content that is present in all HTML pages, such as headers or footers. When an attacker can inject commands into the SSI directives, [Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server-Side_Includes_(SSI)_Injection) can occur. SSI injection can lead to data leakage or even remote code execution
