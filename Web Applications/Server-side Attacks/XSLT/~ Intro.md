XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) server-side injection is a vulnerability that arises when an attacker can manipulate XSLT transformations performed on the server. XSLT is a language used to transform XML documents into other formats, such as HTML, and is commonly employed in web applications to generate content dynamically. In the context of XSLT server-side injection, attackers exploit weaknesses in how XSLT transformations are handled, allowing them to inject and execute arbitrary code on the server
