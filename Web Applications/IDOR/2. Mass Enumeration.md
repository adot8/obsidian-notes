Exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities is easy in some instances but can be very challenging in others. Once we identify a potential IDOR, we can start testing it with basic techniques to see whether it would expose any other data. As for advanced IDOR attacks, we need to better understand how the web application works, how it calculates its object references, and how its access control system works to be able to perform advanced attacks that may not be exploitable with basic techniques.
