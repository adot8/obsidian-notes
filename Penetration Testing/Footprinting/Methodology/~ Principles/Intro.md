| 2.        | Distinguish between what we see and what we do not see.                |
| 3.        | There are always ways to gain more information. Understand the target. |
The whole enumeration process is divided into three different levels:

|`Infrastructure-based enumeration`|`Host-based enumeration`|`OS-based enumeration`|
|---|---|---|

|**Layer**|**Description**|**Information Categories**|
|---|---|---|
|`1. Internet Presence`|Identification of internet presence and externally accessible infrastructure.|Domains, Subdomains, vHosts, ASN, Netblocks, IP Addresses, Cloud Instances, Security Measures|
|`2. Gateway`|Identify the possible security measures to protect the company's external and internal infrastructure.|Firewalls, DMZ, IPS/IDS, EDR, Proxies, NAC, Network Segmentation, VPN, Cloudflare|
|`3. Accessible Services`|Identify accessible interfaces and services that are hosted externally or internally.|Service Type, Functionality, Configuration, Port, Version, Interface|
|`4. Processes`|Identify the internal processes, sources, and destinations associated with the services.|PID, Processed Data, Tasks, Source, Destination|
|`5. Privileges`|Identification of the internal permissions and privileges to the accessible services.|Groups, Users, Permissions, Restrictions, Environment|
|`6. OS Setup`|Identification of the internal components and systems setup.|OS Type, Patch Level, Network config, OS Environment, Configuration files, sensitive private files|
As we have probably already noticed, we can see that we will encounter one gap and very likely several. The interesting and very common fact is that not all the gaps we find can lead us inside. All penetration tests are limited in time, but we should always keep in mind that one belief that there is nearly always a way in. Even after a four-week penetration test, we cannot say 100% that there are no more vulnerabilities. Someone who has been studying the company for months and analyzing them will most likely have a much greater understanding of the applications and structure than we were able to gain within the few weeks we spent on the assessment. An excellent and recent example of this is the [cyber attack on SolarWinds](https://www.rpc.senate.gov/policy-papers/the-solarwinds-cyberattack), which happened not too long ago. This is another excellent reason for a methodology that must exclude such cases.
