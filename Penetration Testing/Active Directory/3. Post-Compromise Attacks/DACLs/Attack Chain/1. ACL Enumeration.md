Get-ADObject -Filter 'isDeleted -eq $true' -IncludeDeletedObjects
```

### BloodHound

 We can set the `wley` user as our starting node, select the `Node Info` tab and scroll down to `Outbound Control Rights`. This option will show us objects we have control over directly, via group membership, and the number of objects that our user could lead to us controlling via ACL attack paths under `Transitive Object Control`. If we click on the `1` next to `First Degree Object Control`, we see the first set of rights that we enumerated, `ForceChangePassword` over the `damundsen` user.

If we right-click on the line between the two objects, a menu will pop up. If we select `Help`, we will be presented with help around abusing this ACE, including:

- More info on the specific right, tools, and commands that can be used to pull off this attack
- Operational Security (Opsec) considerations
- External references.

We'll dig into this menu more later on.

#### Investigating ForceChangePassword Further

If we click on the `16` next to `Transitive Object Control`, we will see the entire path that we painstakingly enumerated above. From here, we could leverage the help menus for each edge to find ways to best pull off each attack.

Finally, we can use the pre-built queries in BloodHound to confirm that the `adunn` user has DCSync rights.

### PowerView
Really inefficient due to the amount of sifting of the output that needs to be done. Lets note it down anyway.

##### ACL enum for specific user / group
```powershell
Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
$sid = Convert-NameToSid student548
Get-DomainObjectACL -ResolveGUIDs -Identity * | ? {$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}
```

> [!NOTE] Note
> If you don't use `-ResolveGUIDs` the output will give us the `ObjectAceType` which is none human readable instead of what the rights are. The string can be googled to find out.

##### LOTL technique - ObjectAceType will have to be googled
```powershell
Get-ADUser -Filter * | Select-Object -ExpandProperty SamAccountName > ad_users.txt
foreach($line in [System.IO.File]::ReadLines("C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\ad_users.txt")) {get-acl  "AD:\$(Get-ADUser $line)" | Select-Object Path -ExpandProperty Access | Where-Object {$_.IdentityReference -match 'INLANEFREIGHT\\wley'}}
```

Attack chain example:

- We have control over the user `wley` whose hash we retrieved earlier in the module (assessment) using Responder and cracked offline using Hashcat to reveal the cleartext password value
- We enumerated objects that the user `wley` has control over and found that we could force change the password of the user `damundsen`
- From here, we found that the `damundsen` user can add a member to the `Help Desk Level 1` group using `GenericWrite` privileges
- The `Help Desk Level 1` group is nested into the `Information Technology` group, which grants members of that group any rights provisioned to the `Information Technology` group
	- `Get-DomainGroup -Identity "Help Desk Level 1" | select memberof`
