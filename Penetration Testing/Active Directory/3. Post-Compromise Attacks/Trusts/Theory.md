Trusts can be transitive or non-transitive.

- A `transitive` trust means that trust is extended to objects that the child domain trusts. For example, let's say we have three domains. In a transitive relationship, if `Domain A` has a trust with `Domain B`, and `Domain B` has a `transitive` trust with `Domain C`, then `Domain A` will automatically trust `Domain C`.
- In a `non-transitive trust`, the child domain itself is the only one trusted.

#### Trust Table Side By Side

| Transitive                                                            | Non-Transitive                              |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Shared, 1 to many                                                     | Direct trust                                |
| The trust is shared with anyone in the forest                         | Not extended to next level child domains    |
| Forest, tree-root, parent-child, and cross-link trusts are transitive | Typical for external or custom trust setups |
An easy comparison to make can be package delivery to your house. For a `transitive` trust, you have extended the permission to anyone in your household (forest) to accept a package on your behalf. For a `non-transitive` trust, you have given strict orders with the package that no one other than the delivery service and you can handle the package, and only you can sign for it.

Trusts can be set up in two directions: one-way or two-way (bidirectional).

- `One-way trust`: Users in a `trusted` domain can access resources in a trusting domain, not vice-versa.
- `Bidirectional trust`: Users from both trusting domains can access resources in the other domain. For example, in a bidirectional trust between `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` and `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`, users in `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` would be able to access resources in `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`, and vice-versa.

Domain trusts are often set up incorrectly and can provide us with critical unintended attack paths. Also, trusts set up for ease of use may not be reviewed later for potential security implications if security is not considered before establishing the trust relationship. A Merger & Acquisition (M&A) between two companies can result in bidirectional trusts with acquired companies, which can unknowingly introduce risk into the acquiring companyâ€™s environment if the security posture of the acquired company is unknown and untested. If someone wanted to target your organization, they could also look at the other company you acquired for a potentially softer target to attack, allowing them to get into your organization indirectly. It is not uncommon to be able to perform an attack such as Kerberoasting against a domain outside the principal domain and obtain a user that has administrative access within the principal domain. I have performed many penetration tests where this was the case
