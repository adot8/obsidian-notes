### Information Disclosure
Let's send a `GET` request with another `uid`:

![get_another_user](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_get_another_user.jpg)

As we can see, this returned the details of another user, with their own `uuid` and `role`, confirming an `IDOR Information Disclosure vulnerability`:

```json
{
    "uid": "2",
    "uuid": "4a9bd19b3b8676199592a346051f950c",
    "role": "employee",
    "full_name": "Iona Franklyn",
    "email": "i_franklyn@employees.htb",
    "about": "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and few minutes of cyber-incident to ruin it."
}
```

This provides us with new details, most notably the `uuid`, which we could not calculate before, and thus could not change other users' details.

### Modifying Other Users' Details
Now, with the user's `uuid` at hand, we can change this user's details by sending a `PUT` request to `/profile/api.php/profile/2` with the above details along with any modifications we made, as follows:

![modify_another_user](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_modify_another_user.jpg)

We don't get any access control error messages this time, and when we try to `GET` the user details again, we see that we did indeed update their details:

![new_another_user_details](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/134/web_attacks_idor_new_another_user_details.jpg)

In addition to allowing us to view potentially sensitive details, the ability to modify another user's details also enables us to perform several other attacks. One type of attack is `modifying a user's email address` and then requesting a password reset link, which will be sent to the email address we specified, thus allowing us to take control over their account. Another potential attack is `placing an XSS payload in the 'about' field`, which would get executed once the user visits their `Edit profile` page, enabling us to attack the user in different ways.

### Chaining Two IDOR Vulnerabilities
Since we have identified an IDOR Information Disclosure vulnerability, we may also enumerate all users and look for other `roles`, ideally an admin role. `Try to write a script to enumerate all users, similarly to what we did previously`.

Once we enumerate all users, we will find an admin user with the following details:

```json
{
    "uid": "X",
    "uuid": "a36fa9e66e85f2dd6f5e13cad45248ae",
    "role": "web_admin",
    "full_name": "administrator",
    "email": "webadmin@employees.htb",
    "about": "HTB{FLAG}"
}
```

We now know the admin role name (`web_admin`), we can set it to our user so we can create new users or delete current users. To do so, we will intercept the request when we click on the `Update profile` button and change our role to `web_admin`:

```json
{
    "uid": "1",
    "uuid": "40f5888b67c748df7efba008e7c2f9d2",
    "role": "web_admin",
    "full_name": "Amy Lindon",
    "email": "a_lindon@employees.htb",
    "about": "A Release is like a boat. 80% of the holes plugged is not good enough."
}
```

We can now create a new user with a `POST` request like so
