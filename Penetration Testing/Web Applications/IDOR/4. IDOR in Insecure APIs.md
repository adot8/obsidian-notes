While `IDOR Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities` allow us to read various types of resources, `IDOR Insecure Function Calls` enable us to call APIs or execute functions as another user. Such functions and APIs can be used to change another user's private information, reset another user's password, or even buy items using another user's payment information.

### Identifying Insecure APIs

When we edit our profile and click update profile we get this API `PUT` request.

We see that the page is sending a `PUT` request to the `/profile/api.php/profile/1` API endpoint. `PUT` requests are usually used in APIs to update item details, while `POST` is used to create new items, `DELETE` to delete items, and `GET` to retrieve item details. So, a `PUT` request for the `Update profile` function is expected.

```bash
{
    "uid": 1,
    "uuid": "40f5888b67c748df7efba008e7c2f9d2",
    "role": "employee",
    "full_name": "Amy Lindon",
    "email": "a_lindon@employees.htb",
    "about": "A Release is like a boat. 80% of the holes plugged is not good enough."
}
```

We can try doing the following:
1. Change the `uid` in the request and change the request type to `GET`
2. Change our `uid` to another user's `uid`, such that we can take over their accounts
3. Change another user's details, which may allow us to perform several web attacks
4. Create new users with arbitrary details, or delete existing users (`POST` `DELETE`)
5. Change our role to a more privileged role (e.g. `admin`) to be able to perform more actions
