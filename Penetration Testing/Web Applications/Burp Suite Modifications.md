### Regex Patterns
- `^TEXT.*$`
	- Starts with TEXT
The type can be changed to match and replace for responses headers, body, etc.
## Payload Processing
Intruder payloads can have rules added to them such as adding prefixes and encoding. They will be read top down like ACL's so encoding multiple times is possible.
