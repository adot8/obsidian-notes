**SSHuttle** creates a tunneled proxy that acts like a new interface, simulating a VPN, allowing us to route our traffic through the proxy without the use of [proxychains](https://oscp.adot8.com/post-exploitation/pivoting/good-to-know/tunneling#proxychains), all using ssh so the **connection is encrypted.**

> [!NOTE] NOTE
> sshuttle only works on Linux machines, python needs to be installed (uploading a python binary is possible) AND you need SSH access to the machine

```shell
sshuttle -r username@address desired_subnet  
sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 172.16.0.0/24
```
Automatically determine subnets with `-N`
```shell
sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 -N
```
Private key
```shell
sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 --ssh-cmd "ssh -i id_rsa" 172.16.0.0/24
```
Receive this error? Then add `-x`
```shell
client: Connected.
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe
client: fatal: server died with error code 255

sshuttle -r user@172.16.0.5 172.16.0.0/24 -x 172.16.0.5
```
