As we've seen, email attacks can lead to sensitive data disclosure through direct access to a user's inbox or by combining a misconfiguration with a convincing phishing email. There are other ways to attack email services that can be very effective as well. A few Hack The Box boxes demonstrate email attacks, such as [Rabbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nnJq_IWJog), which deals with brute-forcing Outlook Web Access (OWA) and then sending a document with a malicious macro to phish a user, [SneakyMailer](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/11/28/htb-sneakymailer.html) which has elements of phishing and enumerating a user's inbox using Netcat and an IMAP client, and [Reel](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2018/11/10/htb-reel.html) which dealt with brute-forcing SMTP users and phishing with a malicious RTF file.
