#### Laudanum, One Webshell to Rule Them All
```
/usr/share/laudanum
```
Laudanum is a repository of ready-made files that can be used to inject onto a victim and receive back access via a reverse shell, run commands on the victim host right from the browser, and more. The repo includes injectable files for many different web application languages to include `asp, aspx, jsp, php,` and more.

**It can be prudent to remove the ASCII art and comments from the file. These items in a payload are often signatured on and can alert the defenders/AV to what you are doing.**
We will only have to change the reverse shell IP and Port.
