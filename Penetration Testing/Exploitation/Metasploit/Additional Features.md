#### Importing modules
[ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com) is a great choice when searching for a custom exploit. We can use tags to search through the different exploitation scenarios for each available script. One of these tags is [Metasploit Framework (MSF)](https://www.exploit-db.com/?tag=3), which, if selected, will display only scripts that are also available in Metasploit module format
```bash
 searchsploit -t Nagios3 --exclude=".py"
...
Nagios3 - 'statuswml.cgi' 'Ping' Command Execution (Metasploit)  
...
```

Always use snake-case, alphanumeric characters, and underscores instead of dashes.

For example:

- `nagios3_command_injection.rb`
- `our_module_here.rb`

```bash
cp ~/Downloads/9861.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/unix/webapp/nagios3_command_injection.rb
```

```bash
msf6 > reload_all
```
If you would like to learn more about porting scripts into the Metasploit Framework, check out the [Metasploit: A Penetration Tester's Guide book from No Starch Press](https://nostarch.com/metasploit). Rapid7 has also created blog posts on this topic, which can be found [here](https://blog.rapid7.com/2012/07/05/part-1-metasploit-module-development-the-series/).
