The [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/) is an industry standard for performing these calculations. Many scanning tools will apply these scores to each finding as a part of the scan results, but it's important that we understand how these scores are derived in case we ever need to calculate one by hand or justify the score applied to a given vulnerability. The CVSS is often used together with the so-called [Microsoft DREAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD_(risk_assessment_model)). `DREAD` is a risk assessment system developed by Microsoft to help IT security professionals evaluate the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities. It is used to perform a risk analysis by using a scale of 10 points to assess the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities. With this, we calculate the risk of a threat or vulnerability based on five main factors:

- Damage Potential
- Reproducibility
- Exploitability
- Affected Users
- Discoverability
### Severity Scoring
The CVSS scoring consists of the `exploitability and impact` of an issue. The `exploitability` measurements consist of `access vector`, `access complexity`, and `authentication`. The `impact` metrics consist of the `CIA triad`, including `confidentiality`, `integrity`, and `availability`.

### Base Metric Group
The CVSS base metric group represents the vulnerability characteristics and consists of `exploitability` metrics and `impact` metrics.
#### Exploitability Metrics

The Exploitability metrics are a way to evaluate the technical means needed to exploit the issue using the metrics below:

- Attack Vector
- Attack Complexity
- Privileges Required
- User Interaction
#### Impact Metrics

The Impact metrics represent the repercussions of successfully exploiting an issue and what is impacted in an environment, and it is based on the CIA triad. The CIA triad is an acronym for `Confidentiality`, `Integrity`, and `Availability`.

### Temporal Metric Group
The `Temporal Metric Group` details the availability of exploits or patches regarding the issue.
#### Exploit Code Maturity
The `Exploit Code Maturity` metric represents the probability of an issue being exploited based on ease of exploitation techniques. There are various metric values associated with this metric, including `Not Defined`, `High`, `Functional`, `Proof-of-Concept`, and `Unproven`

A`'Not Defined'`value relates to skipping this particular metric. A `'High'` value represents an exploit consistently working for the issue and is easily identifiable with automated tools. A `Functional `value indicates there is exploit code available to the public. A `Proof-of-Concept `demonstrates that a PoC exploit code is available but would require changes for an attacker to exploit the issue successfully.
#### Remediation Level
The `Remediation level` is used to identify the prioritization of a vulnerability. The metric values associated with this metric include `Not Defined`, `Unavailable`, `Workaround`, `Temporary Fix`, and `Official Fix`.

A` 'Not Defined' `value relates to skipping this particular metric. An `'Unavailable'` value indicates there is no patch available for the vulnerability. A `'Workaround' `value indicates an unofficial solution released until an official patch by the vendor. A` 'Temporary Fix' `means an official vendor has provided a temporary solution but has not released a patch yet for the issue. An `'Official Fix'` indicates a vendor has released an official patch for the issue for the public.
#### Report Confidence
`Report Confidence` represents the validation of the vulnerability and how accurate the technical details of the issue are. The metric values associated with this metric include `Not Defined`, `Confirmed`, `Reasonable`, and `Unknown`.

A 'Not Defined' value relates to skipping this particular metric. A 'Confirmed' value indicates there are various sources with detailed information confirming the vulnerability. A 'Reasonable' value indicates sources have published information about the vulnerability. However, there is no complete confidence that someone would achieve the same result due to missing details of reproducing the exploit for the issue.
### Calculating CVSS Severity
The calculation of a CVSS v3.1 score takes into account all the metrics discussed in this section. The National Vulnerability Database has a calculator available to the public [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator).

#### CVSS Calculation Example
For example, for the Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability, CVSS Base Metrics is 8.8. You can reference the values of each metric value [here](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527).**
