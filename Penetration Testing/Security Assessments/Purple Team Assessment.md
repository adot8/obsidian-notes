A `blue team` consists of defensive security specialists. These are often people who work in a SOC (security operations center) or a CSIRT (computer security incident response team). Often, they have experience with digital forensics too. So if blue teams are defensive and red teams are offensive, red mixed with blue is purple.

`What's a purple team?`

`Purple teams` are formed when `offensive` and `defensive` security specialists work together with a common goal, to improve the security of their network. Red teams find security problems, and blue teams learn about those problems from their red teams and work to fix them. A purple team assessment is like a red team assessment, but the blue team is also involved at every step. The blue team may even play a role in designing campaigns. "We need to improve our PCI DSS compliance. So let's watch the red team pentest our point-of-sale systems and provide active input and feedback during their work."
