There are a few ways to mitigate this attack. To ensure that these spoofing attacks are not possible, we can disable LLMNR and NBT-NS. As a word of caution, it is always worth slowly testing out a significant change like this to your environment carefully before rolling it out fully. As penetration testers, we can recommend these remediation steps, but should clearly communicate to our clients that they should test these changes heavily to ensure that disabling both protocols does not break anything in the network.

We can disable LLMNR in Group Policy by going to Computer Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Network --> DNS Client and enabling "Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution."

NBT-NS cannot be disabled via Group Policy but must be disabled locally on each host. We can do this by opening `Network and Sharing Center` under `Control Panel`, clicking on `Change adapter settings`, right-clicking on the adapter to view its properties, selecting `Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)`, and clicking the `Properties` button, then clicking on `Advanced` and selecting the `WINS` tab and finally selecting `Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP`.

While it is not possible to disable NBT-NS directly via GPO, we can create a PowerShell script under Computer Configuration --> Windows Settings --> Script (Startup/Shutdown) --> Startup with something like the following:

Code: powershell

```powershell

$regkey = "HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces"
Get-ChildItem $regkey |foreach { Set-ItemProperty -Path "$regkey\$($_.pschildname)" -Name NetbiosOptions -Value 2 -Verbose}
```

In the Local Group Policy Editor, we will need to double click on `Startup`, choose the `PowerShell Scripts` tab, and select "For this GPO, run scripts in the following order" to `Run Windows PowerShell scripts first`, and then click on `Add` and choose the script. For these changes to occur, we would have to either reboot the target system or restart the network adapter.

To push this out to all hosts in a domain, we could create a GPO using `Group Policy Management` on the Domain Controller and host the script on the SYSVOL share in the scripts folder and then call it via its UNC path such as:

`\\inlanefreight.local\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts`

Once the GPO is applied to specific OUs and those hosts are restarted, the script will run at the next reboot and disable NBT-NS, provided that the script still exists on the SYSVOL share and is accessible by the host over the network.

## Detection

It is not always possible to disable LLMNR and NetBIOS, and therefore we need ways to detect this type of attack behavior. One way is to use the attack against the attackers by injecting LLMNR and NBT-NS requests for non-existent hosts across different subnets and alerting if any of the responses receive answers which would be indicative of an attacker spoofing name resolution responses. This [blog post](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/a-simple-and-effective-way-to-detect-broadcast-name-resolution-poisoning-bnrp/) explains this method more in-depth.

Furthermore, hosts can be monitored for traffic on ports UDP 5355 and 137, and event IDs [4697](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4697) and [7045](https://www.manageengine.com/products/active-directory-audit/kb/system-events/event-id-7045.html) can be monitored for. Finally, we can monitor the registry key `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient` for changes to the `EnableMulticast` DWORD value. A value of `0` would mean that LLMNR is disabled.
