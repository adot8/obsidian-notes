The Windows Remote Management (`WinRM`) is a simple Windows integrated remote management protocol based on the command line. WinRM uses the Simple Object Access Protocol (`SOAP`) to establish connections to remote hosts and their applications. Therefore, WinRM must be explicitly enabled and configured starting with Windows 10. WinRM relies on `TCP` ports `5985` and `5986` for communication, with the last port `5986 using HTTPS`, as ports 80 and 443 were previously used for this task. However, since port 80 was mainly blocked for security reasons, the newer ports 5985 and 5986 are used today.
