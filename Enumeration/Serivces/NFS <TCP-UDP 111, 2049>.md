`Network File System` (`NFS`) is a network file system developed by Sun Microsystems and has the same purpose as SMB.

|**Version**|**Features**|
|---|---|
|`NFSv2`|It is older but is supported by many systems and was initially operated entirely over UDP.|
|`NFSv3`|It has more features, including variable file size and better error reporting, but is not fully compatible with NFSv2 clients.|
|`NFSv4`|It includes Kerberos, works through firewalls and on the Internet, no longer requires portmappers, supports ACLs, applies state-based operations, and provides performance improvements and high security. It is also the first version to have a stateful protocol.|
A significant advantage of NFSv4 over its predecessors is that only one UDP or TCP port `2049` is used to run the service, which simplifies the use of the protocol across firewalls.

The most common authentication is via UNIX `UID`/`GID` and `group memberships`, which is why this syntax is most likely to be applied to the NFS protocol. One problem is that the client and server do not necessarily have to have the same mappings of UID/GID to users and groups, and the server does not need to do anything further. No further checks can be made on the part of the server. This is why NFS should only be used with this authentication method in trusted networks.

### Default Configuration
Configurations stored in `/etc/exports`, which contains a table of physical filesystems on an NFS server accessible by the clients

```shell
adot8@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/exports 

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#               to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
```

|**Option**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`rw`|Read and write permissions.|
|`ro`|Read only permissions.|
|`sync`|Synchronous data transfer. (A bit slower)|
|`async`|Asynchronous data transfer. (A bit faster)|
|`secure`|Ports above 1024 will not be used.|
|`insecure`|Ports above 1024 will be used.|
|`no_subtree_check`|This option disables the checking of subdirectory trees.|
|`root_squash`|Assigns all permissions to files of root UID/GID 0 to the UID/GID of anonymous, which prevents `root` from accessing files on an NFS mount.|
### Creating a NFS Share
```bash
root@nfs:~$ echo '/mnt/nfs  10.129.14.0/24(sync,no_subtree_check)' >> /etc/exports
root@nfs:~$ systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server 
root@nfs:~$ exportfs

/mnt/nfs      	10.129.14.0/24
```
We have shared the folder `/mnt/nfs` to the subnet `10.129.14.0/24` with the setting shown above. This means that all hosts on the network will be able to mount this NFS share and inspect the contents of this folder

### Dangerous Settings
| **Option**       | **Description**                                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `rw`             | Read and write permissions.                                                                                          |
| `insecure`       | Ports above 1024 will be used.                                                                                       |
| `nohide`         | If another file system was mounted below an exported directory, this directory is exported by its own exports entry. |
| `no_root_squash` | All files created by root are kept with the UID/GID 0.                                                               |
