The `Simple Mail Transfer Protocol` (`SMTP`) is a protocol for sending emails in an IP network. It can be used between an email client and an outgoing mail server or between two SMTP servers. SMTP is often combined with the IMAP or POP3 protocols, which can fetch emails and send emails.

The 587 port on newer SMTP servers is used to receive mail from authenticated users/servers, usually using the STARTTLS command to switch the existing plaintext connection to an encrypted connection.

|**Port**|**Service**|
|---|---|
|`TCP/25`|SMTP Unencrypted|
|`TCP/143`|IMAP4 Unencrypted|
|`TCP/110`|POP3 Unencrypted|
|`TCP/465`|SMTP Encrypted|
|`TCP/587`|SMTP Encrypted/[STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS)|
|`TCP/993`|IMAP4 Encrypted|
|`TCP/995`|POP3 Encrypted|

Sending mail looks like the following:

|Client (`MUA`)|`➞`|Submission Agent (`MSA`)|`➞`|Open Relay (`MTA`)|`➞`|Mail Delivery Agent (`MDA`)|`➞`|Mailbox (`POP3`/`IMAP`)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
SMTP has two disadvantages inherent to the network protocol.

1. The first is that sending an email using SMTP does not return a usable delivery confirmation. Although the specifications of the protocol provide for this type of notification, its formatting is not specified by default, so that usually only an English-language error message, including the header of the undelivered message, is returned.
    
2. Users are not authenticated when a connection is established, and the sender of an email is therefore unreliable. As a result, open SMTP relays are often misused to send spam en masse. The originators use arbitrary fake sender addresses for this purpose to not be traced (mail spoofing). Today, many different security techniques are used to prevent the misuse of SMTP servers. For example, suspicious emails are rejected or moved to quarantine (spam folder). For example, responsible for this are the identification protocol [DomainKeys](http://dkim.org/) (`DKIM`), the [Sender Policy Framework](https://dmarcian.com/what-is-spf/) (`SPF`).

For this purpose, an extension for SMTP has been developed called `Extended SMTP` (`ESMTP`). When people talk about SMTP in general, they usually mean ESMTP. ESMTP uses TLS, which is done after the `EHLO` command by sending `STARTTLS`. This initializes the SSL-protected SMTP connection, and from this moment on, the entire connection is encrypted, and therefore more or less secure. Now [AUTH PLAIN](https://www.samlogic.net/articles/smtp-commands-reference-auth.htm) extension for authentication can also be used safely.

### Default Configuration
```bash
adot8@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/postfix/main.cf | grep -v "#" | sed -r "/^\s*$/d"

smtpd_banner = ESMTP Server 
biff = no
append_dot_mydomain = no
readme_directory = no
compatibility_level = 2
smtp_tls_session_cache_database = btree:${data_directory}/smtp_scache
myhostname = mail1.inlanefreight.htb
alias_maps = hash:/etc/aliases
alias_database = hash:/etc/aliases
smtp_generic_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/generic
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost 
masquerade_domains = $myhostname
mynetworks = 127.0.0.0/8 10.129.0.0/16
mailbox_size_limit = 0
recipient_delimiter = +
smtp_bind_address = 0.0.0.0
inet_protocols = ipv4
smtpd_helo_restrictions = reject_invalid_hostname
home_mailbox = /home/postfix
```

### Commands
SMTP servers can be interacted with using `telnet` and or `netcat`

| **Command**  | **Description**                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `AUTH PLAIN` | AUTH is a service extension used to authenticate the client.                                     |
| `HELO`       | The client logs in with its computer name and thus starts the session.                           |
| `MAIL FROM`  | The client names the email sender.                                                               |
| `RCPT TO`    | The client names the email recipient.                                                            |
| `DATA`       | The client initiates the transmission of the email.                                              |
| `RSET`       | The client aborts the initiated transmission but keeps the connection between client and server. |
| `VRFY`       | The client checks if a mailbox is available for message transfer.                                |
| `EXPN`       | The client also checks if a mailbox is available for messaging with this command.                |
| `NOOP`       | The client requests a response from the server to prevent disconnection due to time-out.         |
| `QUIT`       | The client terminates the session.                                                               |
##### Initialize Session (HELO/EHLO)

> [!NOTE] Note
> Sometimes we may have to work through a web proxy. We can also make this web proxy connect to the SMTP server. The command that we would send would then look something like this: `CONNECT 10.129.14.128:25 HTTP/1.0`

##### Verify Users (VRFY)
**This can be unreliable and return false positives. Don't trust automatic tools**!
```bash
adot8@htb[/htb]$ telnet 10.129.14.128 25

Trying 10.129.14.128...

> [!NOTE] Note
> This would be anonymous access as a finding if we're able to verify users
> Email services use authentication to allow users to send emails and receive emails. A misconfiguration can happen when the SMTP service allows anonymous authentication or support protocols that can be used to enumerate valid usernames.

### Dangerous Settings
To prevent the sent emails from being filtered by spam filters and not reaching the recipient, the sender can use a relay server that the recipient trusts. It is an SMTP server that is known and verified by all others. As a rule, the sender must authenticate himself to the relay server before using it.

Often, administrators have no overview of which IP ranges they have to allow. This results in a misconfiguration of the SMTP server that we will still often find in external and internal penetration tests. Therefore, they allow all IP addresses not to cause errors in the email traffic and thus not to disturb or unintentionally interrupt the communication with potential and current customers.
#### Open Relay Configuration
```shell
mynetworks = 0.0.0.0/0
```
With this setting, this SMTP server can send fake emails and thus initialize communication between multiple parties. Another attack possibility would be to spoof the email and read it
