Vulnerability assessments are performed because an organization chooses to conduct them, and they can control how and when they're assessed. Security audits are different. `Security audits` are typically requirements from outside the organization, and they're typically mandated by `government agencies` or `industry associations` to assure that an organization is compliant with specific security regulations.

For example, all online and offline retailers, restaurants, and service providers who accept major credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, etc.) must comply with the [PCI-DSS "Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard"](https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/faq/#1). PCI DSS is a regulation enforced by the [Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org), an organization run by credit card companies and financial service industry entities. A company that accepts credit and debit card payments may be audited for PCI DSS compliance, and noncompliance could result in fines and not being allowed to accept those payment methods anymore.

Regardless of which regulations an organization may be audited for, it's their responsibility to perform vulnerability assessments to assure that they're compliant before they're subject to a surprise security audit.
