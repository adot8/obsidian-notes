## MSF Engagement Structure

The MSF engagement structure can be divided into five main categories.

- Enumeration
- Preparation
- Exploitation
- Privilege Escalation
- Post-Exploitation

This division makes it easier for us to find and select the appropriate MSF features in a more structured way and to work with them accordingly. Each of these categories has different subcategories that are intended for specific purposes. These include, for example, Service Validation and Vulnerability Research.
