Several steps can be taken to mitigate the risk of password spraying attacks. While no single solution will entirely prevent the attack, a defense-in-depth approach will render password spraying attacks extremely difficult.

|Technique|Description|
|---|---|
|`Multi-factor Authentication`|Multi-factor authentication can greatly reduce the risk of password spraying attacks. Many types of multi-factor authentication exist, such as push notifications to a mobile device, a rotating One Time Password (OTP) such as Google Authenticator, RSA key, or text message confirmations. While this may prevent an attacker from gaining access to an account, certain multi-factor implementations still disclose if the username/password combination is valid. It may be possible to reuse this credential against other exposed services or applications. It is important to implement multi-factor solutions with all external portals.|
|`Restricting Access`|It is often possible to log into applications with any domain user account, even if the user does not need to access it as part of their role. In line with the principle of least privilege, access to the application should be restricted to those who require it.|
|`Reducing Impact of Successful Exploitation`|A quick win is to ensure that privileged users have a separate account for any administrative activities. Application-specific permission levels should also be implemented if possible. Network segmentation is also recommended because if an attacker is isolated to a compromised subnet, this may slow down or entirely stop lateral movement and further compromise.|
|`Password Hygiene`|Educating users on selecting difficult to guess passwords such as passphrases can significantly reduce the efficacy of a password spraying attack. Also, using a password filter to restrict common dictionary words, names of months and seasons, and variations on the company's name will make it quite difficult for an attacker to choose a valid password for spraying attempts.|
## Detection

Some indicators of external password spraying attacks include many account lockouts in a short period, server or application logs showing many login attempts with valid or non-existent users, or many requests in a short period to a specific application or URL.

In the Domain Controllerâ€™s security log, many instances of event ID [4625: An account failed to log on](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4625) over a short period may indicate a password spraying attack. Organizations should have rules to correlate many logon failures within a set time interval to trigger an alert. A more savvy attacker may avoid SMB password spraying and instead target LDAP. Organizations should also monitor event ID [4771: Kerberos pre-authentication failed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4771), which may indicate an LDAP password spraying attempt. To do so, they will need to enable Kerberos logging. This [post](https://www.hub.trimarcsecurity.com/post/trimarc-research-detecting-password-spraying-with-security-event-auditing) details research around detecting password spraying using Windows Security Event Logging.

With these mitigations finely tuned and with logging enabled, an organization will be well-positioned to detect and defend against internal and external password spraying attacks.

## External Password Spraying

While outside the scope of this module, password spraying is also a common way that attackers use to attempt to gain a foothold on the internet. We have been very successful with this method during penetration tests to gain access to sensitive data through email inboxes or web applications such as externally facing intranet sites. Some common targets include:

- Microsoft 0365
- Outlook Web Exchange
- Exchange Web Access
- Skype for Business
- Lync Server
- Microsoft Remote Desktop Services (RDS) Portals
- Citrix portals using AD authentication
- VDI implementations using AD authentication such as VMware Horizon
- VPN portals (Citrix, SonicWall, OpenVPN, Fortinet, etc. that use AD authentication)
- Custom web applications that use AD authentication
