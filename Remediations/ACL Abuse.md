## Detection and Remediation

A few recommendations around ACLs include:
1. `Auditing for and removing dangerous ACLs`

Organizations should have regular AD audits performed but also train internal staff to run tools such as BloodHound and identify potentially dangerous ACLs that can be removed.

1. `Monitor group membership`

Visibility into important groups is paramount. All high-impact groups in the domain should 
be monitored to alert IT staff of changes that could be indicative of an ACL attack chain.

1. `Audit and monitor for ACL changes`

Enabling the [Advanced Security Audit Policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/canitpro/step-by-step-enabling-advanced-security-audit-policy-via-ds-access) can help in detecting unwanted changes, especially [Event ID 5136: A directory service object was modified](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-5136) which would indicate that the domain object was modified, which could be indicative of an ACL attack. If we look at the event log after modifying the ACL of the domain object, we will see some event ID `5136` created:

If we check out the `Details` tab, we can see that the pertinent information is written in [Security Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/security-descriptor-definition-language) which is not human readable.

#### Viewing Associated SDDL

We can use the [ConvertFrom-SddlString cmdlet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/convertfrom-sddlstring?view=powershell-7.2) to convert this to a readable format.

```

If we choose to filter on the `DiscretionaryAcl` property, we can see that the modification was likely giving the `mrb3n` user `GenericWrite` privileges over the domain object itself, which could be indicative of an attack attempt.

There are many tools out there that can be used to help monitor AD. These tools, when used in conjunction with a highly mature AD secure posture, and combined with built-in tools such as the various ways we can monitor for and alert on events in Active Directory, can help to detect these types of attacks and prevent them from going any further.
