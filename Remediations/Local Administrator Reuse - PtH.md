This technique, while effective, is quite noisy and is not a good choice for any assessments that require stealth. It is always worth looking for this issue during penetration tests, even if it is not part of our path to compromise the domain, as it is a common issue and should be highlighted for our clients. One way to remediate this issue is using the free Microsoft tool [Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46899) to have Active Directory manage local administrator passwords and enforce a unique password on each host that rotates on a set interval.
