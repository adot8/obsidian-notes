Bitwise operators are operators that manipulate the individual bits of a binary value, performing operations on each corresponding bit position. The bitwise operators are shown below:

- Right shift (`>>`)
- Left shift (`<<`)
- Bitwise OR (`|`)
- Bitwise AND (`&`)
- Bitwise XOR (`^`)
- Bitwise NOT (`~`)

#### Right and Left Shift

The right shift (`>>`) and left shift (`<<`) operators are used to shift the bits of a binary number to the right and left by a specified number of positions, respectively.

Shifting right discards the rightmost number of bits by the specified value and zero bits of the same amount are inserted into the left. For example, the image below shows `10100111` shifted right by `2`, to become `00101001`.

On the other hand, shifting left discards the leftmost bits and the same number of zero bits are inserted from the right handside. For example, the image below shows `10100111` shifted left by `2`, to become `10011100`.
