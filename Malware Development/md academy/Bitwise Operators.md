Bitwise operators are operators that manipulate the individual bits of a binary value, performing operations on each corresponding bit position. The bitwise operators are shown below:

- Right shift (`>>`)
- Left shift (`<<`)
- Bitwise OR (`|`)
- Bitwise AND (`&`)
- Bitwise XOR (`^`)
- Bitwise NOT (`~`)

#### Right and Left Shift

The right shift (`>>`) and left shift (`<<`) operators are used to shift the bits of a binary number to the right and left by a specified number of positions, respectively.

Shifting right discards the rightmost number of bits by the specified value and zero bits of the same amount are inserted into the left. For example, the image below shows `10100111` shifted right by `2`, to become `00101001`.

On the other hand, shifting left discards the leftmost bits and the same number of zero bits are inserted from the right handside. For example, the image below shows `10100111` shifted left by `2`, to become `10011100`.

#### Bitwise OR

The bitwise OR operation is a logical operation that involves two binary values at the bit level. It evaluates each bit of the first operand against the corresponding bit of the second operand, generating a new binary value. The new binary value contains a 1 in any bit position where either one or both of the corresponding bits in the original values are 1.

The following table represents the bitwise OR output with all the possible input bits.

#### Bitwise AND

The bitwise AND operation is a logical operation that involves two binary values at the bit level. This operation sets the bits of the new binary value to 1 only in the case where the corresponding bits of both input operands are 1.

The following table represents the bitwise AND output with all the possible input bits.

#### Bitwise XOR

The bitwise XOR operation (also known as exclusive OR) is a logical operation that involves two binary values at the bit level. If only one of the bits is 1, the result in each position is 1. Conversely, if both bits are 0 or 1, the output is 0.

The following table represents the bitwise XOR output with all the possible input bits.

#### Bitwise NOT

The bitwise NOT operation takes one binary number and flips all its bits. In other words, it changes all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s. The following table represents the bitwise NOT output with all the possible input bits.
