|`float`|a number with possible decimals|6 decimal places|

```c
int main() {
  
  // Fix the missing data types

```


Initializing variables
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  int numOfBooks = 69;
  char favLetter = 'D';
  char favDigit = '9';
  double costOfCandyBar = 69.420;

  printf("Number of books: %d\n", numOfBooks);
  printf("Your Favorite Letter is: %c\n", favLetter);
  printf("Your Favorite Digit is: %c\n", favDigit);
  printf("You expect to pay $%.3f for a candy bar.\n", costOfCandyBar);
}
```


Float and Double

> [!NOTE] **Note**
> **A float has less precision than a double, 6 vs 15 possible decimal places respectively, and therefore takes up less memory (4 vs 8 bytes)**. However, a double run faster, so you gain speed at the cost of more memory usage.
> 
The other thing to be aware of is that the system is rounding the values you store in either. This can cause unexpected results, especially with a float as they have less precision. This is why you will see double being used any time accuracy is important, such as in scientific, medical or financial applications.


**Constants** prevent any changes during execution once the value is set at declaration

It is also a best practice to use all upper case letters when declaring a constant:
```c
const int DAYSINWEEK = 7;
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
// Speed of light is 1.86e5 mi/s or 186000 mi/s we will store 1.86 and do the multiplicaiton later.
  const double SPEEDOFLIGHT = 1.86;
  int timeTraveledInSeconds = 30;

  // No need to change below here
  printf("Light would travel %.2f miles in %d seconds\n", SPEEDOFLIGHT * 100000 * timeTraveledInSeconds, timeTraveledInSeconds);

}
```


Casting Types

| Type     | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implicit | The compiler will try to convert them at runtime; can be dangerous as you might not know what values will be in the variable at runtime, and it might not be implicitly convertible to another type.     |
| Explicit | Tell the compiler what you want to set the type to, i.e. `a = (int)b`;<br>That way if b was something other than 3.0, such as 3.2, we are telling the compiler to make it work, so it would set it to 3. |

We can convert a `char` to a number type, or the other way around.

> A char doesnâ€™t store 'a', it stores the value representing that: 97 for lowercase and 65 for uppercase.

Example; `targetInt` equals 97.
```c
int targetInt;
char sourceChar = 'a';
targetInt = (int)sourceChar;
```

Example 2; `targetChar` now equals `'A'`.
```c
int sourceInt = 65;
char targetChar;
targetChar = (char)sourceInt;
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  char targetChar;
  int sourceInt = 99;
  double sourceDouble = 55.67;

  // Cast here
  targetChar = (char)sourceInt;
  // targetChar = sourceDouble;

  // No need to change below here
  printf("source int %d, source double, %.2f, target %c\n", sourceInt, sourceDouble, targetChar);

}
```

Playing
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){

  int test, caster, tocast;
  double hyper;
  char first, last, caster2;

  tocast = 69;
  test = 1;
  hyper = 3.696969696969;
  first = 'Y';
  last = 'N';

  caster = (int)hyper;
  caster2 = tocast;

  printf("My int is %d!\n", test);
  printf("My double/float is %.10f frfr\n", hyper);
  printf("I am a\t%c%c", first, last);
  printf("\nCasting = %d", caster);
  printf("\nCasting2 = %c", caster2);

}
```

Mathematical Operations

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  // Variables set for you, do not change here
  int booksSold = 100;
  double bookCost = 9.99;
  double totalSalesValue;

  // Make your changes here
  booksSold += 200;
  totalSalesValue = booksSold * bookCost;
  totalSalesValue /= 2;
  
  // Output logic, no need to change this
  printf("You sold %d books and your take home was $%.2f\n", booksSold, totalSalesValue);
}
```


Modulo
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  int endingDayOfWeek = 0;
  int daysThatPass = 67;
  int daysInWeek = 7;

  endingDayOfWeek = daysThatPass % daysInWeek;

  printf("You started on the 1st (0) day of the week, went %d days from this, so it is now the %d day of the week\n", daysThatPass, endingDayOfWeek);
}
```


> [!NOTE] Note 
> The value of `endingDayOfWeek` is set to the remainder of `daysThatPass` divided by `daysInWeek`. This remainder tells you how many days past the last full week you are. Since weeks repeat every 7 days, the remainder gives the current day of the week after the given number of days.


Increment and Decrement
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int n = 13;
  int m = 10;
  
  m--;
  n++;

  printf("m = %d\n", m);
  printf("n = %d\n", n);
}
```


Assignment (shorthand)
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  int timesServerCrashed = 5;
  double losses = 500.95;

  losses *= timesServerCrashed;
  losses /= 2;

  printf("Total Losses: $%.2f\n", losses);
}
```


Comparisons


| Symbol      | Comparison                               |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `==`        | Equal to                                 |
| `!=`        | Not equat                                |
| `>`<br>`>=` | Greater than<br>Greater than or equal to |
| `<`<br>`<=` | Less than<br>Less than or equal to       |


```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  int x = 5;
  int y = 42;

  if (x <= y) {
   printf("Congratulations on setting up a comparison correctly!");
  }

}
```


Logical Operators

| Operator    | Effect                                 |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `&&`        | Both are true (AND)                    |
| \| \|       | One is true (OR)                       |
| `(!(a==b))` | Opposite of the equation is the result |

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  
int a = 2;
int b = 3;
if (a == b && a == 2) {
  printf("both are true\n");
}
if (a == b || a == 2) {
  printf("one or both are true\n");
}
if (!(a == b)) {
  printf("they are not equal\n");
}
