A `union` is similar to a `struct` in that it can store members of different data types.

However, there are some differences:

- In a `struct`, each member has its own memory.
- In a `union`, all members **share the same memory**, which means you can only use one of the values at a time.

> Most of the time, you will use `structs` instead of unions, as it can store and access multiple values at the same time, which is more common in everyday programs.
>  
>  However, unions are useful when you only need to store one of several possible types at a time, and you want to save memory.


#### Declare a Union

To create a union, use the `union` keyword, and then create a variable from it (just like with structs):

```c
union myUnion {        // Union declaration
  int myNum;           // Member (int)
  char myLetter;       // Member (char)
  char myString[30];   // Member (char array)
}; 

int main() {
  union myUnion u1;  // Create a union variable with the name "u1":
  return 0;
} 
```

#### Access Union Members

And just like with structs, to access members of a Union, use the dot `.` syntax.

**Important:** Since all members share the same memory, changing one will affect the others. Only the **last assigned member** holds a valid value:

```c
union myUnion {  
  int myNum;  
  char myLetter;  
  char myString[30];  
};  
  
int main() {  
  union myUnion u1;  
  
  u1.myNum = 1000;  
  
  // Since this is the last value written to the union, myNum no longer holds 1000 - its value is now invalid  
  u1.myLetter = 'A';  
  
  printf("myNum: %d\n", u1.myNum); // This value is no longer reliable  
  printf("myLetter: %c\n", u1.myLetter); // Prints 'A'  
  
  return 0;  
}
```

#### Size of a Union

The size of a `union` will always be the same as the size of its largest member:

```c
union myUnion {  
  int myNum;  
  char myString[36];  
};  
  
int main() {  
  union myUnion u1;  
  printf("Size of union: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(u1));  
  return 0;  
}
```

> Since the largest member is 36 bytes, the entire `union` will also be **36 bytes**.
> 
> If it was a `struct` instead, the size would be 40 bytes:  
> `myNum` (4 bytes) + `myString` (36 bytes) = **40 bytes total**

## When to Use Unions

Use unions when:

- You need to store different types in the same location
- You only use one type at a time
- Saving memory is very important
