A `union` is similar to a `struct` in that it can store members of different data types.

However, there are some differences:

- In a `struct`, each member has its own memory.
- In a `union`, all members **share the same memory**, which means you can only use one of the values at a time.

> Most of the time, you will use `structs` instead of unions, as it can store and access multiple values at the same time, which is more common in everyday programs.
>  
>  However, unions are useful when you only need to store one of several possible types at a time, and you want to save memory.
