When we write programs in C, we define many different names for variables, functions, and other identifiers. We may find that our access to these named components is unavailable in certain parts of our program.

Is there a way for us to know when certain names are available? As it turns out, the _scope_ of the name tells us exactly this.

#### What Is Scope?

Scope refers to the part of a program where a name has a meaning.  
For example:

```c
int someFunction() {  int myVariableName = 20;}  int main() {  char myVariableName[] = "10"; }
```

In the example above:

- `myVariableName` in `someFunction()` refers to an `int` variable whose value is `20`
- `myVariableName` in `main()` refers to an `char[]` variable whose value is `"10"`
- Both these variables have the same name but different meaning depending on their scope

In C, scopes are defined within curly braces, `{}`, and therefore can be created using constructs like `if` statements and functions.  
For example:

```c
void myFunc() {
  // function scope
  int b = 10;
  if (b > 5) {
    // if scope
    int c = 4;
  }
}
```

There are two scopes in the above example:

- A scope within the `myFunc()` function defined with the outer braces
- A scope within the `if` statement curly braces, also inside the `myFunc()` scope
- The `if` braces “enclose” the meaning of `c` within it and make it unknown outside of `if` block.
- The `myFunc()` braces “enclose” the meaning of `b` within it and make it unknown outside of the function.
