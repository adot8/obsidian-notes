Pin Login Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int pin = 0;
  int tries = 0;

  printf("BANK OF CODECADEMY:\n");
  printf("Enter your PIN: ");
  scanf("%d", &pin);

  tries++;

  while (pin != 1234 && tries < 3) {
    printf("Enter your PIN: ");
    scanf("%d", &pin);
    tries++;
  }

  if (pin == 1234) {
    printf("PIN accepted!\n");
    printf("You now have access.\n");
  }
}
```


while loop 

> the `while` loop will continue to execute the code inside of it, _over and over again_, as long as the condition is `true`.

```c
while (condition) {
  // Statement(s)
}
```

Guess tha number
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int guess;
  int tries = 0;

  printf("I’m thinking of a number in the range 1-10.\n");
  printf("Try to guess it: ");
  scanf("%d", &guess);

  // Write a while loop here:

  while (guess !=8 && tries < 50){
  printf("\nWrong number, guess again: ");
  scanf("%d", &guess);
  tries++;
  }


  if (guess == 8) {
    printf("You got it!\n");
  }
}
```


Printing squares
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int i = 9;
  int square = 0;

  // Write a while loop here:
  while (i >= 0){
    square = i * i;
    printf("%d\t%d\n", i, square);
    i--;
  }

}
```


do-while Loop

>  Simply put, it does something first, and then checks the condition afterward and loops in this manner until the condition is no longer true.
>  
>  The `do-while` loop is most often used when a program wants to do something at least once before checking the condition.

```c
do {
  // Statement(s)
} while (condition);
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int i = 0; // Change this to 11 to see the difference in a while and do-while loop

  do {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
  } while (i < 10);


  /* while (i < 10) {
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
  } */
  
}
```


for loops
```c
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

There are three parts to this separated by two `;`:

- The initialisation of a _counter_: `int i = 0`
- The condition: `i < 10`
- The change in the counter (in this case an increment): `i++`


> [!NOTE] **Note**
> This distinction is important because it allows us to `switch` between `while` loops and `for` loops  to best fit the current program’s needs. If we don’t quite know when a loop may end, we use a `while` loop. If we _do_ know exactly when a loop should end, we use a `for` loop.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int i = 99;

  // Write your loop here
  /*while (i > 0){
    printf("%d bottles of pop on the wall.\n", i);
    printf("Take one down and pass it around.\n");
    printf("%d bottles of pop on the wall.\n", i - 1);
    i--;
  }*/

  for (int i = 99; i > 0; i--){
    printf("%d bottles of pop on the wall.\n", i);
    printf("Take one down and pass it around.\n");
    printf("%d bottles of pop on the wall.\n", i -1);
  }
  
}
```


Breaking Out

>`break` is most often used when a program wants to run a loop infinitely in a controlled manner. For example, a program that runs until the user types “quit.” In that instance, the program may run forever, but will only break out of its running loop when the user tells it.

```C
while (tries < 50) {
  scanf("%d", &guess);

  if (guess == 8) {
    break;
  }

  printf("Wrong guess, try again: ");
  tries++;
}
```

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int number1 = 1;
  int numbers_entered1 = 0;

  int number2 = 1;
  int numbers_entered2 = 0;

  while (numbers_entered1 < 10) {
    printf("Loop 1 - Please enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number1);
    // Figure out how to break out here!
    if (number1 <= 0){
      break;
    }
    numbers_entered1++;
  }

  while (number2 > 0 && numbers_entered2 < 10){
    printf("Loop 2 - Please enter a number: ");
    scanf("%d", &number2);

    numbers_entered2++;
  }

  printf("Good job! You’ve broken out!\n");
}
```


Continuing

Inside the `for` loop, we see an `if` statement checking if the current counter, `i`, is an even number by using the `%` operator. If `i` is even, `continue` to the next iteration (back to the top) and _skip_ the print statement below. If `i` is odd, print `i` and continue as normal.

```C
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i % 2 == 0) {
    continue;
  }
  printf("%d is odd\n", i);
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int i = 0;

  /* while (i < 10) {
    // Figure out how to skip the print of 5 here
    if (i == 5){
      i++;
      continue;
    } 
    printf("%d\n", i);
    i++;
  }*/

  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++){ 
	  if (i == 5){
		  continue;	
	  } 
	printf("%d\n", i);    
  }
  
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int learning = 1;
  int cont;

  while (learning++ < 10) {

    printf("Congratulations! Are you ready to continue learning in the next lesson?\n");
    printf("1 - Yes\t2 - No\n");

    scanf("%d", &cont);

    if (cont == 1) {

      printf("Awesome! Let's break out and move forward!\n");
      break;

    } else {

      printf("Okay! Keep practicing! And remember to take breaks!\n");

    }

  }

}
```
