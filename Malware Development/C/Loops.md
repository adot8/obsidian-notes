Pin Login Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int pin = 0;
  int tries = 0;

  printf("BANK OF CODECADEMY:\n");
  printf("Enter your PIN: ");
  scanf("%d", &pin);

  tries++;

  while (pin != 1234 && tries < 3) {
    printf("Enter your PIN: ");
    scanf("%d", &pin);
    tries++;
  }

  if (pin == 1234) {
    printf("PIN accepted!\n");
    printf("You now have access.\n");
  }
}
```


while loop 

> the `while` loop will continue to execute the code inside of it, _over and over again_, as long as the condition is `true`.

```c
while (condition) {
  // Statement(s)
}
```

Guess tha number
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int guess;
  int tries = 0;

  printf("Iâ€™m thinking of a number in the range 1-10.\n");
  printf("Try to guess it: ");
  scanf("%d", &guess);

  // Write a while loop here:

  while (guess !=8 && tries < 50){
  printf("\nWrong number, guess again: ");
  scanf("%d", &guess);
  tries++;
  }


  if (guess == 8) {
    printf("You got it!\n");
  }
}
```


Printing squares
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {

  int i = 9;
  int square = 0;

  // Write a while loop here:
  while (i >= 0){
    square = i * i;
    printf("%d\t%d\n", i, square);
    i--;
  }

}
```


do-while Loop

>  Simply put, it does something first, and then checks the condition afterward and loops in this manner until the condition is no longer true.

```c
do {
  // Statement(s)
} while (condition);
```
