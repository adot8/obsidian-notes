#### Calling a Function

```c
#include <stdio.h>

printf("Hello, World!"); // Outputs: Hello, World!
int num = 9;
printf("My number is %d", num); // Outputs: My number is 9
```

In the example above, the first `printf()` call takes the string `"Hello, World!"` as an argument. The output is the string. The second `printf()` call takes two arguments, a string and a variable. The output this time is the string with the variable inserted where indicated by `%d`. These two uses of `printf()` show the flexibility that is allowed when using functions.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int num1 = -5;
  int num2 = 42;
  // Write your code below
  printf("%d and %d oranges!", num1, num2);
  
}
```

#### Library Functions

> In order to have access to these functions you need to include header files like `<stdio.h>` and `<stdlib.h>`

- `ceil()`: takes any number as an argument, rounds it up to the nearest integer, and returns the integer.
- `log()`: takes an integer as an argument and returns the natural logarithm of the given number.
- `toupper()`: takes a `char` as an argument and returns the uppercase of any alphabetic character.
- `isupper()`: takes a `char` as an argument and returns `1` if the character is an uppercase letter, `0` otherwise.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void) {
  srand(time(NULL));
  // Write your code below
  int randomNumber = rand() % 20 + 1;
  printf("%d", randomNumber);
}
```

Above code:

> The `srand()` function is used to set the _seed_ for the random number generator. The seed initializes the random generation and should be a number that changes over time. The `time()` function is used as the `srand()` argument to ensure that the seed is a different number every time the code is run. When passed the argument `NULL`, the `time()` function will return the number of seconds passed since the date, January 1, 1970

> To get a random number between 1-20 we use the `rand()` function, modulus (`%`) 20 `+` 1
> Without this the output would be a larger random number
