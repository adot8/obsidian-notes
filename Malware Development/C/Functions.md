#### Calling a Function

```c
#include <stdio.h>

printf("Hello, World!"); // Outputs: Hello, World!
int num = 9;
printf("My number is %d", num); // Outputs: My number is 9
```

In the example above, the first `printf()` call takes the string `"Hello, World!"` as an argument. The output is the string. The second `printf()` call takes two arguments, a string and a variable. The output this time is the string with the variable inserted where indicated by `%d`. These two uses of `printf()` show the flexibility that is allowed when using functions.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
  int num1 = -5;
  int num2 = 42;
  // Write your code below
  printf("%d and %d oranges!", num1, num2);
  
}
```

#### Library Functions

> In order to have access to these functions you need to include header files like `<stdio.h>` and `<stdlib.h>`

- `ceil()`: takes any number as an argument, rounds it up to the nearest integer, and returns the integer.
- `log()`: takes an integer as an argument and returns the natural logarithm of the given number.
- `toupper()`: takes a `char` as an argument and returns the uppercase of any alphabetic character.
- `isupper()`: takes a `char` as an argument and returns `1` if the character is an uppercase letter, `0` otherwise.

[List of C functions](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.3.0?topic=extensions-standard-c-library-functions-table-by-name)


```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void) {
  srand(time(NULL));
  // Write your code below
  int randomNumber = rand() % 20 + 1;
  printf("%d", randomNumber);
}
```

Above code:

> The `srand()` function is used to set the _seed_ for the random number generator. The seed initializes the random generation and should be a number that changes over time. The `time()` function is used as the `srand()` argument to ensure that the seed is a different number every time the code is run. When passed the argument `NULL`, the `time()` function will return the number of seconds passed since the date, January 1, 1970

> To get a random number between 1-20 we use the `rand()` function, modulus (`%`) 20 `+` 1
> Without this the output would be a larger random number


#### Defining Functions

The function signature tells us 3 things:

- the function name
- how many parameters (inputs) and their types
- what type of return value is to be expected

```c
returnType functionName (type1 parameter1, type2 parameter2)
```

The code statements “inside” the function are known as the body of the function and are enclosed with curly braces after the function signature.

```c
returnType functionName (type1 parameter1, type2 parameter2) {
  // code statement 1;
  // code statement 2;

return output;
}
```

The signature and the body are the two parts we need to create our own functions. 

```c
void makeCookie(){
  printf("Milk\n");
  printf("Flour\n");
  printf("Chocolate Chips\n");
  printf("Butter\n");
  printf("Thanks for the ingredients, here's a cookie!\n");
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Write your code below
void printMyFavoriteAnimal(){
  printf("My favorite animal is a dog");
}

int main(void) {
  printMyFavoriteAnimal();
}
```


#### Function Return Values

```c
int getSecretNumber() {
  int secretNumber = 7;
  return secretNumber;  
}
```

In the example above:

- The function has a return type `int`
- The variable `secretNumber`, of type `int`, is set to `7`
- The variable is returned using `return secretNumber`

> Return value must match the function type or there will be a compilation error

Once the return statement is executed, the function gives control back to the function that called it and no further code within the function will be executed. For example:

```c
int getSecretNumber(){
  int secretNumber = 7;
  return secretNumber;  
  printf("Don’t tell anyone\n"); // This won't be executed
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

// Modify the code below
int getRandom1000() {
  int random1000 = rand() % 1000 + 1;
  return random1000;
  
}

int main(void) {
  srand(time(NULL));
  // Modify the code below
  int randomNumber = getRandom1000();
  printf("My random number is: %d", randomNumber);
}
```

#### Function Parameters

Parameters are variable definitions that take place in between the parentheses of the function signature. They have a type and are given a name to be used inside and only inside the function body.

```c
int addTwo(int number1, int number2) {
  int sum = number1 + number2;
  return sum;
}

int main() {
  int addedNumbers = addTwo(3, 6);
  // addedNumbers = 9
}
```

One thing to keep in mind is if the parameter type and the argument passed to a function do not match, a warning or an error will occur when we run the code.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void sayIt(int number) {
  printf("%d\n", number);
}

int main(void) {
  char* string = "Hi!";
  sayIt(string);
}

/* 
The code above will produce a warning that the `sayIt` function argument type, `char*` and the parameter type, `int` are not the same. This will result in unwanted behavior.
/*

```


> The last thing to note about parameters is if a function does not have any parameters you should put `void` in between the parentheses. Leaving them empty will usually be OK, but it is best practice to use `void`.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

// Modify the code below
int getRandomNumber(int maxNumber) {
  srand(time(NULL));
  int randomNumber = rand() % maxNumber + 1;
  return randomNumber;
}

int main(void) {
  // Moved `srand(time(NULL));` to the function
  int randomNumber = getRandomNumber(100);
  printf("My random number is: %d", randomNumber);
}
```


#### Functions with Pointers

When a function has received an argument, the function makes a copy of the argument’s value and stores it in the parameter variable. Now any work that the function does on that parameter variable will not affect the original value passed in. For example:
 
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void myFunc(int a){
  a = a + 2;
  printf("a inside myFunc(): %d\n", a);
}

int main(){
  int a = 10;
  myFunc(a);
  printf("a in main(): %d\n", a);
}

//OUTPUT:
// a inside myFunc(): 12;
// a in main(): 10;

```

This is great because we can safely alter the variable value inside the function while maintaining the original value outside.

What if we want to alter the variable inside the function? Instead of passing the actual variable as an argument, we can pass a pointer to the variable. Remember, a pointer is a variable that holds the memory address to another variable. The memory address tells you where the original variable is in memory.

Before we pass a pointer to a function we need to make sure the parameter type matches the type of pointer we are passing. With a pointer as a parameter, the body of the function can directly alter the original value of the pointer that was passed:

```c
void myFunc(int* a){
  *a = *a+2;
  printf("a inside myFunc(): %d\n", *a);
}

int main(){
  int a = 10;
  int* aPointer = &a;
  myFunc(aPointer);
  printf("a in main(): %d\n", a);
}

//OUTPUT:
// a inside myFunc(): 12;
// a in main(): 12;

```

A benefit of using a pointer to a variable as opposed to the variable itself is that it saves memory as the function does not need to allocate more memory for complex data types like arrays.
