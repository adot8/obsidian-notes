A **cast** converts one type to another (or tells the compiler to _treat_ a value as a different type).  
Examples:

```c
int x = 42;
double d = (double)x;     // cast int to double

void *p = malloc(8);
int *ip = (int *)p;       // treat void* as int*
```

Here the cast doesn’t change the address stored in the pointer — it only changes how the compiler **interprets** that address (what type it thinks it points to).

If you don’t cast and the types are incompatible, the compiler will warn or refuse the code. The cast silences that and forces the interpretation.
