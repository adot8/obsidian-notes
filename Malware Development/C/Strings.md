 > `\0` must be added when using an initialised array but it is added automatically when using literal strings
 > 
 > `\0` is also added to the total size to the string (as a character)


```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
  // Checkpoint 1 code goes here
  char comp[] = {'C', 'o', 'm', 'p', 'u', 't', 'e', 'r', '\0'};
  // Checkpoint 2 code goes here
  char compCode[] = "Computer Code";
  // Checkpoint 3 code goes here   
  printf("%s\n", comp);   
  printf("%s", compCode);   
}
```


> It is not possible to add characters or delete them, just like in a regular array

Character Access and Modification

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char p[] = "procezzor";
  // Checkpoint 1 code goes here
  printf("%c\n", p[2]);
  // Checkpoint 2 code goes here
  p[5] = 's';
  p[6] = 's';
  printf("%s", p);
}
```


Looping Through Strings

> When using the `strlen()` function the string library needs to be included in the code like so:
> 
>>>>>>>>>`#include<string.h>`
>
>Note that `strlen()` does not account for the null terminating character.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

int main() {
  char s[] = "When the zombies arrive, quickly fax Judge Pat Alphabet";
  char p[] = "poolloop";  
  // Checkpoint 1 code goes here
  for (int i = 0; i < strlen(s); i++){
    s[i] = '*';
  }
  printf("%s\n", s);
  
  // Checkpoint 2 code goes here
  for (int j = 0; j < strlen(p)/2; j++){
    p[j] = '#';
  }
  printf("%s", p);
}
```


Concatenating Strings

> It’s important to understand that the `strcat()` function appends the characters from the `src` string to the end of the `dst` string
> 
>  `strcat(dst, src);`
>  
>  `dst` must have enough allocated space to accommodate the characters from `src`. If not, `strcat()` will concatenate the string anyway without causing any compiler errors. This can result in a buffer overflow, potentially corrupting adjacent data in memory
>
>When accounting for space in `dst` make sure to account for the null character, `\0`

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

int main() {
    
  char s1[14] = "London";
  char s2[] = " Bridge";

  char n[20] = "New";
  char y[] = " York";
  char c[] = " City";

  // Code for checkpoint 1 goes here
  strcat(s1, s2);
  printf("%s\n", s1);
  // Code for checkpoint 2 goes here
  strcat(n, y);
  strcat(n, c);
  printf("%s\n", n);
}
```


Copying Strings
 
`strcpy(dst, src);`

>It is important that the size of the empty character array, `dst`, be greater than or equal to the length of the string `src` plus one for the null character (‘\0’) in order to accommodate all incoming characters. If the `dst` char array is too short, the program will exhibit undefined behaviour. Similar to the `strcat()` function, a new string will not be created.

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>

int main() {
  
  char src[] = "banana";
  char dst[7];
  
  char pan[] = "How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!";
  int len = strlen(pan) + 1; // Checkpoint 2
  char dst2[len];
  
  // Code for checkpoint 1 goes here
  strcpy(dst, src);
  printf("%s\n", dst);  
  
  // Code for checkpoint 3 goes here
  strcpy(dst2, pan);
  printf("%s", dst2);

}
```


---
- In C, strings are simply arrays of the `char` data type.
- Since strings are arrays, they are subject to all the properties and constraints of an array.
    - You cannot change the size of a string.
    - You cannot delete characters from a string; only replace them.
    - Modifying a character in a string is done in the same way as modifying an element in an array.
    - You can loop through a string like you would an array.
- A string can be created in one of two ways:
    - The first being an array of `char`s: `char str[] = {'S', 't', 'r', 'i', 'n', 'g', '\0'};`
    - The second and more convenient is to use a string literal: `char str[] = "String";`
- An empty string of length `len`, is created like so: `char str[len];`
- All strings must end with the null terminating character ‘\0’.
    - This character _must_ be added manually when creating a string using the array method.
    - This character is automatically added when creating a string using a string literal.
- The length of a string is the number of characters it contains plus one to account for the null character.
- There exists a library in the C language that contains common functions that are used to operate on strings. The library is imported by including the line `#include<string.h>` at the top of the code.
- The `strlen()` function returns the number of characters in that string, excluding the null terminator.
    - Syntax: `strlen(str);`
- The `strcat()` function concatenates two strings together.
    - Syntax: `strcat(dst, src);`
    - `strcat()` will append the characters from `src` to the `dst` string. It is important to ensure that enough space is available to avoid a buffer overflow.
    - The empty string must be long enough to accommodate the original string or else undefined behavior will occur.
