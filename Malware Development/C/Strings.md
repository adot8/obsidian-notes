 > Strings can be made using initialised arrays (Chk 1) or with a literal string (Chk 2)
 > 
 > `\0` must be added when using an initialised array but it is added automatically when using literal strings
 > 
 > `\0` is also added to the total size to the string (as a character)


```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
  // Checkpoint 1 code goes here
  char comp[] = {'C', 'o', 'm', 'p', 'u', 't', 'e', 'r', '\0'};
  // Checkpoint 2 code goes here
  char compCode[] = "Computer Code";
  // Checkpoint 3 code goes here   
  printf("%s\n", comp);   
  printf("%s", compCode);   
}
```


> It is not possible to add characters or delete them, just like in a regular array

Character Access and Modification

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  char p[] = "procezzor";
  // Checkpoint 1 code goes here
  printf("%c\n", p[2]);
  // Checkpoint 2 code goes here
  p[5] = 's';
  p[6] = 's';
  printf("%s", p);
}
```


> When using the `strlen()` function the string library needs to be included in the code like so:
>>>>>>>>>`#include<string.h>`
