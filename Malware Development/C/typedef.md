The `typedef` keyword lets you create a new name (an **alias**) for an existing type. This can make complex declarations easier to read, and your code easier to maintain.

For example, instead of always writing `float`, we can create a new type called `Temperature` to make the code clearer:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

typedef float Temperature;

int main() {
  Temperature today = 25.5;
  Temperature tomorrow = 18.6;

  printf("Today: %.1f C\n", today);
  printf("Tomorrow: %.1f C\n", tomorrow);

  return 0;
}
```

> Here, `Temperature` is just another name for `float`. However, the code is more expressive: it tells us that these numbers are **temperatures**, not just any floating-point numbers.

#### Why Use typedef?

- **Simplifies code**: Shorter, easier-to-read type names.
- **Improves clarity**: Expresses intent better (for example, `AGE` instead of just `int`). Also helps avoid confusion when many variables share the same base type (like `float` or `double`).

#### typedef with struct

`typedef` can be useful with `struct`, because it lets you avoid writing `struct` every time:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Without typedef:
struct Car {
  char brand[30];
  int year;
};

// With typedef:
typedef struct {
  char brand[30];
  int year;
} Car;

int main() {
  struct Car car1 = {"BMW", 1999}; // needs "struct"
  Car car2 = {"Ford", 1969}; // shorter with typedef

  printf("%s %d\n", car1.brand, car1.year);
  printf("%s %d\n", car2.brand, car2.year);
  return 0;
}
```

This example shows how `typedef` makes it easier to work with multiple struct variables, like different car models:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  
  
// With typedef  
typedef struct {  
  char brand[30];  
  char model[30];  
  int year;  
} Car;  
  
int main() {  
  Car car1 = {"BMW", "X5", 1999};  
  Car car2 = {"Ford", "Mustang", 1969};  
  Car car3 = {"Toyota", "Corolla", 2011};  
  
  printf("%s %s %d\n", car1.brand, car1.model, car1.year);  
  printf("%s %s %d\n", car2.brand, car2.model, car2.year);  
  printf("%s %s %d\n", car3.brand, car3.model, car3.year);  
  
  return 0;  
}
```

Here you can see how `typedef` keeps the code clean when structs are nested inside other structs:

```c
#include <stdio.h>  
  
// Define three structs with typedef  
typedef struct {  
  char firstName[20];  
  char lastName[20];  
} Owner;  
  
typedef struct {  
  char brand[20];  
  int year;  
  Owner owner;  
} Car;  
  
typedef struct {  
  char name[30];  
  Car featuredCar;  
} Dealership;  
  
int main() {  
  Owner person = {"John", "Doe"};  
  Car car1 = {"Toyota", 2010, person};  
  Dealership d = {"City Motors", car1};  
  
  printf("Dealership: %s\n", d.name);  
  printf("Featured Car: %s (%d), owned by %s %s\n",  
    d.featuredCar.brand,  
    d.featuredCar.year,  
    d.featuredCar.owner.firstName,  
    d.featuredCar.owner.lastName);  
  
  return 0;  
}
```
