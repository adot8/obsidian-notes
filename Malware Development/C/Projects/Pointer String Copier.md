```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<string.h>
 
void copy(char* dst, char* src){

  // Loop until the end of the source string
  while (*src != '\0'){
    // Copy each character
    *dst = *src;
    src++;
    dst++;
  }
  // Add null terminator
  *dst = '\0'; 

}
 
int main(){
  char srcString[] = "We promptly judged antique ivory buckles for the next prize!";
  char dstString[strlen(srcString) + 1];
  
  // Use function
  copy(dstString, srcString);
  printf("%s", dstString);
}
```

---

1.

Inside this function:

```c
void copy(char* dst, char* src){
  // Code for copying a string goes here
}
```

Remove the comment and write an empty `while` loop (both condition and body should be empty) that will be used to traverse the string. You will fill in the loop condition and loop body in later tasks.

2.

Inside the loop body, write code that will copy the character pointed to by `src` into the address stored in `dst`.

3.

Increment the `src` pointer by one so that it points to the next character in the source string.

4.

Increment the `dst` pointer so that it points to the next available space in the destination string.

5.

Fill in the loop condition such that the loop stops when the character pointed to by `src` is the null terminating character (`'\0'`)

6.

Since the loop terminated when `src` was pointing to the terminating character, that character was not copied into the `dst` string!

`dst` is already pointing to what should be the last character. Set that character to the null terminating character.

### Testing the Function

7.

Let’s test your new copy function!

Inside `main()`, under the string `srcString`, create a new string called `dstString` that will be as long as `srcString`. Don’t forget to account for the terminating character!

8.

Use your `copy()` function to copy `srcString` into `dstString`.

9.

Let’s prove that your `copy()` function works! Print the `dstString`.
