Creating and Initializing Arrays
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  // Checkpoint 1 code goes here.
  double q[5];
  // Checkpoint 2 code goes here.
  int evens[] = {2,4,6,8,10};

}
```


Array Access and Element Modification

> The first element in an array has index 0 and the last element in an array has index arraySize - 1. The nth element is at index n-1, so, for example, the third element would be at index 2.

An element in an array is modified just like a regular variable:
```c
arr[idx] = newValue
```

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

  int evens[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12};
  int odds[] = {1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11}; // Do not modify this line.
  
  printf("%i\n", evens[5]); // Checkpoint 1. Fix this error.

  // Code for checkpoint 2 goes here.
  printf("%d\n", evens[2]);
  // Code for checkpoint 3 goes here.
  odds[1] = 3;
  odds[4] = 9;
}
```
