Creating and Initializing Arrays
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
  
  // Checkpoint 1 code goes here.
  double q[5];
  // Checkpoint 2 code goes here.
  int evens[] = {2,4,6,8,10};

}
```


Array Access and Element Modification

> The first element in an array has index 0 and the last element in an array has index arraySize - 1. The nth element is at index n-1, so, for example, the third element would be at index 2.

An element in an array is modified just like a regular variable:
```c
arr[idx] = newValue
```

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {

  int evens[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12};
  int odds[] = {1, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11}; // Do not modify this line.
  
  printf("%i\n", evens[5]); // Checkpoint 1. Fix this error.

  // Code for checkpoint 2 goes here.
  printf("%d\n", evens[2]);
  // Code for checkpoint 3 goes here.
  odds[1] = 3;
  odds[4] = 9;
}
```


Looping Through Arrays

1. Loop through array `arr` and print each element on a separate line. The array contains 20 elements.
2. Given the integer array `arr2`, fill up the array so that each element in the array is four plus the index of the element. Ex: `arr[0] = 4, arr[1] = 5, arr[2] = 6, etc.`

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
  int arr[] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 20, 22, 26, 28, 29};
  int arr2[100];

    // Code for Checkpoint 1 goes here
  int i = 0;
  while (i < 20){
    printf("%d\n", arr[i]);
    i++;
  }
  // Code for Checkpoint 2 goes here
  int x;
  for (x = 0; x < 100; x++){
    arr2[x] = x + 4;
    printf("%d\n", arr2[x]);
  }
}
```


Length of Array Using `sizeof()`

> `sizeof()` returns the amount of bytes the array holds in memory (an int is 4 bytes each so 5 entries would be 20 bytes)
> 
> We can get the real length of the array by dividing the amount of bytes by the length of one entry using the datatype :) Example: `length = sizeof(numbers)/sizeof(int);`
> 
> The length value can now be used in loops as limit as opposed to hard-coding it in.

Example
```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
  int arr[] = {3, 2, 10, 6, 18, 5, 8, 4, 0, 9}; 
  int len = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(int);
  for(int i = 0; i < len; i++){
    printf("%i\n", arr[i]);
  }
}
```

```c
#include<stdio.h>

int main() {
  double arr[] = {1.0, 8, 2.27, 16.2, 2, 3.14, 12.6, 1.62, 6.54, 9, 11};
  int len;
  
  // Checkpoint 1 code goes here.
  len = sizeof(arr)/sizeof(double);
  printf("%i\n", len);

  // Checkpoint 2 code goes here.
  int i = 0;
  while (i < len){
    printf("%f\n", arr[i]);
    i++;
  }
}
```


Multidimensional Arrays

> Arrays can also store other arrays! An array containing other arrays is known as a multidimensional array. These kinds of arrays are frequently used in mathematical applications that involve matrices and vectors. Similar to its single dimension counterpart, a multidimensional array can be initialized or uninitialized upon its creation. Letâ€™s take a look at the uninitialized version first. The following is a two-dimensional array of integers called mat which represents a three-by-four matrix:

```c
int mat[3][4];
```

The previous code indicates that the array `mat` contains three elements each of which is an array that contains four integers. To visualise this, consider a row of three lockers, in which each locker contains four sub-lockers that someone can store items in. To illustrate how to create an initialized multidimensional array, we will create a two-by-three multidimensional array called `mat2` composed of random integer values.

```c
int mat2[][3] = {{1, 6, 3}, {5, 9, 2}};
```

Just like in the single dimension case, the array is initialized by placing elements between `{}` brackets. In this case, the elements inside the outermost brackets are arrays of three elements each. It is important to note that while the two-by-three dimension can be inferred from the right-hand side of the expression, the only dimension that can be omitted is the first (notice the first `[]` is empty); all others must be supplied. The array `mat2`, represents this table:
