#### Architecture

- Registers are small memory storage areas built into the processor (still volatile memory)
- Intel has 16 "general purpose" registers + the instruction pointer which points at the next instruction to execute
	- But 2 of the 16 are not that general
- On x86-32,  registers are 32 bits wide (used to be 8 general purpose registers)
- On x86-64,  registers are 64 bits wide
