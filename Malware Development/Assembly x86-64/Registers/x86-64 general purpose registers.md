#### Architecture

- Registers are small memory storage areas built into the processor (still volatile memory)
- Intel has 16 "general purpose" registers + the instruction pointer which points at the next instruction to execute
	- But 2 of the 16 are not that general
- On x86-32,  registers are 32 bits wide (used to be 8 general purpose registers)
- On x86-64,  registers are 64 bits wide

- R0-15 for 64 bit version
- R0D-15D for 32 bit version


- R1 through 7 are sort of OG general purpose registers made to work with the previous versions
- R8 through 15 were introduced when 64 bit was introduced to the world
	- They made a consistent naming convention 
		- R8 (Quadword/Qword in Windows)
		- R8DoubleWord
		- R8Word
		- R8Byte
