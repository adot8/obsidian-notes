- Endianness comes from the term in which people go to war over how to eat soft boild egges
- This concept is the same for how values are stored in RAM

#### Little Endian (Intel)

`0x12345678` would be stored in RAM "little end" first

> The least significant byte (LSB) of a word or larger is stored in the lowest address.
> e.g. 0x78, 0x56, 0x34, 0x12


#### Big Endian

`0x12345678` would be stored in RAM "big end" first

> The most significant byte (MSB) of a word or larger is stored in the lowest address.
> e.g. 0x12, 0x34, 0x56, 0x78

- Network traffic is sent in Big Endian order
- ARM started out Little Endian and now is Bi-Endian (configurable both ways)
