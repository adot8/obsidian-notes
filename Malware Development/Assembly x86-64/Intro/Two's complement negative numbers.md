A "signed" type in C, is one which can represent either positive or negative values. An "unsigned" type is one which can only represent positive values.

Because both a signed and unsigned type have the same number of bits, this means that half the positive range must be used to represent negative numbers when data is treated as signed.

So for instance a "unsigned char" can hold the values 0-255, but a "signed char", can hold positive 0x01 to 0x7F (127), and then values 0x80 to 0xFF represent -128 to -1 respectively. Because 0x80 is binary 10000000b, and 0xFF is 11111111b, we can see that the most significant digit in all the negative numbers is always 1. So sometimes this most significant digit is referred to as the "sign bit", with 1 indicating the number is negative.

Negative values are represented as the "two's complement" of their positive value. Two's complement is computedÂ by flipping all the bits, and adding 1.

So for instance, I said that 0xFF is -1. This can be confirmed by flipping all the bits (11111111b -> 00000000b), and then adding 1 (00000001) to yield a positive 1. Or for instance -128 is 10000000 -> 01111111 + 1 = 10000000 = 128.

The same rules for ranges which applied to one byte values can extend to 2, 4, 8, etc byte values.

2 byte positive range = 0x0001 to 0x7FFF (32767), negative range = 0x8000 (-32768) to 0xFFFF (-1)

4 byte positive range = [0x00000001, 0x7FFFFFFF], negative range = [0x80000000, 0xFFFFFFFF]
