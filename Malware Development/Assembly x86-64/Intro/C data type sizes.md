So a "char" is a single byte, a "short" is two bytes, etc.

The term "word" originally referred to Intel's native 16 bit data size when x86 was a 16 bit architecture. Thus when it expanded to 32 bit, that size was referred to as a "double word". This "double word" terminology was adopted as the "DWORD" data type name in Windows programming. Likewise for 64 bit, "QWORD" is often used on Windows.
