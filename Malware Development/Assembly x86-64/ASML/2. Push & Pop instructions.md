### As seen in Hello.c (macOS and Linux)

Just like in the [Stack Overview](obsidian://open?vault=Offensive%20Security&file=root%2FMalware%20Development%2FAssembly%20x86-64%2FASML%2FStack%20overview) data gets pushed and popped which is what they do

> GCC/Clang HelloWorlds have balanced Push/Pop instructions but Windows VS doesn't (still the same)

### PUSH

#### Push quadword onto the stack

- The push instruction automatically decrements the stack pointer, `RSP`, by 8
> This means that the stack grows 8 addresses (going to the lower address ofc)
- In 64-bit execution mode, operand (PUSH) can also be the following:
	- The value in a 64-bit register
	- A 64-bit value from memory, as given in "r/mX" from talked about next

#### "r/mX" Addressing Forms 

- Bro made up "r/mX" to refer to anywhere you see "r/m8", "r/m16", "r/m32" or "r/m64" in the intel manual

> An "r/mX" is a way to specify either a register or memory value in 8,16,32 or 64 bits long

- In Intel syntax, most of the time square brackets [] means to treat the value within as a memory address, and fetch the value at that address and pull it out (like dereferencing a pointer)

- An "r/mX"  can take 4 forms
	1. Register -> `rbx`
	2. Memory, base-only -> `[rbx]`
		1. Take the value of rbx, treat it as a memory address, deference it, pull the value out of that and boom thats the value used instead (makes no sense lol) **DONT USE RBX USE THE VALUE POINTED TO bY RBX**
	3. Memory, base+index\*scale -> `[rbx+rcx*X]`
		1. Take register, add it to another register and times it by X
		2.  X can be 1,2,4 or 8 (nothing else)
	4. Memory, base+index\*scale+displacement -> `[rbx+rcx*X+Y]`
		1. 
		2. For Y of 1 byte (0-255  / 0-2^8) or 4 bytes (0-4 billion  /  0-2^32)

- ` base + index \*scale + displacement ` has a natural applicability to multi-dimensional array indexing, arrays of structs, etc

- For future instructions
	- Support access to memory = memory is encoded in "r/mX" form
	-  "r/mX" can be something as simple as a register or as complicated as a memory address calculation in that form
