### As seen in Hello.c (macOS and Linux)

Just like in the [Stack Overview](obsidian://open?vault=Offensive%20Security&file=root%2FMalware%20Development%2FAssembly%20x86-64%2FASML%2FStack%20overview) data gets pushed and popped which is what they do

> GCC/Clang HelloWorlds have balanced Push/Pop instructions but Windows VS doesn't (still the same)

### PUSH

#### Push quadword onto the stack

- The push instruction automatically decrements the stack pointer, `RSP`, by 8
> This means that the stack grows 8 addresses (going to the lower address ofc)
- In 64-bit execution mode, operand (PUSH) can also be the following:
	- The value in a 64-bit register
	- A 64-bit value from memory, as given in "r/mX" from talked about next

#### "r/mX" Addressing Forms 1

- Bro made up "r/mX" to refer to anywhere you see "r/m8", "r/m16", "r/m32" or "r/m64" in the intel manual
