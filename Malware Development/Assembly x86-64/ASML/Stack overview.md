### The Stack 1

- A stack in Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where data is "pushed" on to the top of the stack and "popped" off the top

> This can be thought of as a stack of plates where you can only take data (plates) off the top but not from the middle.

- The stack is a conceptual area of main memory (RAM) which is designated by the OS when a program is started

- Different OSes start at different addresses by their own convention, or if they're using address space layout randomization (ASLR) this can be randomised

---
### The Stack 2

By convention **the `stack` grows toward lower memory addresses (and the `heap` higher)**. Adding something to the stack means the top of the stack is now at the lower memory address

> If you use too much `stack` and or too much `heap` they'll collide and cause the program to exit

# THE STACK GROWS DOWN (Lower Addresses)

---
### The Stack 3

- RSP (Really-long stack pointer) points to the top of the stack - **_The lowest address which is being used_** 
	- While data will exist at addresses beyond the top of the stack, it is considered _undefined_

---

### The Stack 4

- What can you find on the stack?
	- "Return addresses" so a called function can return back to the function that called it
