- NOP = No-Operation ; No registers, No values, nothin
- Just used to pad/align bytes, or to delay time
- Can be used to make simple exploits more reliable

#### Also...

> The one-byte NOP instruction is an alias mnemonic for the XCHG (E)AX, (E)AX instruction

XCHNG basically **exchanges** the value between two registers; which is what NOP does in exchanges the register value of registers to itself... this does absolutely **nothing**


| Register | Hex                      |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| NOP      | 0x90 or (1-9 bytes long) |
