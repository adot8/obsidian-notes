#### PE Primer

The OS loader reads the program (PE) from disk and loads it into memory as a process

To simplify it's format, the PE format (headers, fields, sections, directories, etc.) can be though of as a book.

A book contains a couple of things:
- "data" - the authors text/contents
- "metadata" - title, author, publisher, date, ToC, etc.

This can look somewhat like this:

| PE FILE            |
| ------------------ |
| Headers (metadata) |
| Sections (data)    |
