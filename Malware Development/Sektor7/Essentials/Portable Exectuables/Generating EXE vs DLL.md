#### EXEs

> EXEs are separate programs that can be loaded into memory as an independent process

At least in C, the `main()` function will be executed after the initialisation process of the executable is completed by the OS loader.

#### DLLs

> Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) are PEs that are loaded into existing processes and cannot live independently in memory. Their main purpose is to deliver functionality to a calling processes needs (ex: performs cryptographic functionalities; or provides extra GUI functionality)

For execution of the DLL, the OS loader has already created a process in memory, when the process needs the DLL for some sort of functionality the loader reads the DLL from disk, reserves space in the target process and loads the function into the space.

The  DLL `main function` is then called by the loader, initialising the library, then finally the loader hands over control to the process to call the needed function.

> When malware is created as a DLL, the DLL `main function `needs to be created and at least one function needs to be exported that can be called externally

## Source Code vs Compiled Code

A **_C compiler_** is a software tool that translates human-readable C programming code into machine-readable binary code, which can be executed by a CPU. The compiler generates _object files_, which are not executable images yet. They need to be reformatted and this is the job of **_a linker_**. Its purpose is to link these object files together, along with any necessary libraries, to produce the final executable file (PE file in the case of Windows).
