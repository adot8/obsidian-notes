**_Function call obfuscation_** in the context of Windows API refers to a technique used by software developers or malware authors to hide or obscure the actual calls to Windows API functions in their code. The goal is to make it harder for reverse engineers and analysts to understand the behavior of the program or to detect specific malicious activities.

Typically when the compiler+linker generate the binary, a list of needed DLLs and functions are being added to Import Table of the final PE file. Based on this information one can try to figure out, what kind of activities the program will perform when loaded into the system's memory.

To circumvent this analysis, malware authors switch to calling Win API functions dynamically, ie. resolving needed functions addresses on-the-fly by using `GetModuleHandle()` and `GetProcAddress()` functions.
