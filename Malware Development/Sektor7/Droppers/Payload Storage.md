#### Droppers

**_Droppers_** are a type of malicious software designed to deliver and install other forms of malware onto a victim's computer system. The name "dropper" comes from the fact that these programs "drop" or install the additional malware (called **_payload_**) onto the target system (either into the disk or system's memory only). Payloads can take various forms: **_shellcode_** (position independent executable code), EXE, DLL, **_reflective DLL_** ("self-loadable" DLL which can load and initialize itself in the process memory without being stored as a file on disk), etc.

The use of droppers allows attackers to separate the delivery mechanism from the actual malware functionality. This approach enables them to create more modular and flexible attack campaigns, so they can easily swap out the payload for different types of malware or update the payload without modifying the dropper itself.

#### .text, .data and .rsrc Sections

- The `.text` (_executable code_) section is typically used to store executable code, such as the instructions that make up the program's actual logic.
- The `.data` (_initialized data_) section is used to store global and static data variables that need to be initialized before the program starts running.
- The `.rsrc` (_resources_) section contains various types of resources used by the application, such as icons, bitmaps, strings, version information, dialog templates, and other non-executable data.
    
All these sections can be used as a payload storage in a dropper.
