## IdentifyHosts
We can use `Wireshark` and `TCPDump` to "put our ear to the wire" and see what hosts and types of network traffic we can capture. This is particularly helpful if the assessment approach is "black box." We notice some [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) requests and replies, [MDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS), and other basic [layer two](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast-l2/topics/topic-map/layer-2-understanding.html) packets (since we are on a switched network, we are limited to the current broadcast domain).
#### Wireshark
Sniff out `ARP` and `MDNS `packets to covertly discover hosts
```shell
sudo -E wireshark
```

#### TCPdump
Sniff the same traffic and save to output to be viewed in wireshark
```bash
sudo tcpdump -i wlan0 -w - -U | tee tcpdump.out | tcpdump -r -
```
#### Responder
Put `Responder`into analyze mode to view `LLMNR`, `NBT-NS`, and `MDNS` traffic
```bash
sudo stdbuf -o0  responder -I wlan0 -A | tee responder.out
```
#### Fping
Discover live hosts and document in hosts.txt file
```bash
fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
network="$1"
outfile=$2
# Discover live hosts
fping -asgq "$network" | tee /dev/tty | grep -oP '\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+' > $outfile
echo "[+] Output saved to $outfile"
```
#### Nmap
```bash
nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oA host_enum.out
```

## Identify Users
Kerbrute takes advantage of the fact that Kerberos pre-authentication failures often will not trigger logs or alerts, which makes it

Using Kerbrute for username enumeration will generate event ID [4768: A Kerberos authentication ticket (TGT) was requested](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4768). This will only be triggered if [Kerberos event logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/enable-kerberos-event-logging) is enabled via Group Policy. Defenders can tune their SIEM tools to look for an influx of this event ID, which may indicate an attack. If we are successful with this method during a penetration test, this can be an excellent recommendation to add to our report.
###### Kerbrute
Use `jsmith.txt` or `jsmith2.txt` user lists from [Insidetrust](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames)
```bash
kerbrute userenum -d DOMAIN.LOCAL --dc 172.16.5.5 jsmith.txt -o valid_ad_users
```
###### Netexec
```bash
netexec smb <IP> -u '' -p '' --users
netexec smb <IP> -u '' -p '' --groups
netexec smb <IP> -u '' -p '' --rid-brute
```
###### rpcclient
```bash
rpcclient -U '' -N 172.16.5.5

cat users.raw | awk -F [ '{print $2}' | awk -F] '{print $1}' > users.txt

###### enum4linux
```shell
enum4linux -U 172.16.5.5
enum4linux -U 172.16.5.5  | grep "user:" | cut -f2 -d"[" | cut -f1 -d"]"
```
###### ldapsearch
```bash
ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "(&(objectclass=user))"  | grep sAMAccountName: | cut -f2 -d" "
```
###### windapsearch.py
```shell
./windapsearch.py --dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -u "" -U
```
## Obtaining the Password Policy
We can always ask our client for their password policy if the goal is as comprehensive an assessment as possible

#### LDAP Anonymous Binds
###### ldapsearch
```bash
ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength
```

Regardless of the method we choose, and if we have the password policy or not, we must always keep a log of our activities, including, but not limited to:

- The accounts targeted
- Domain Controller used in the attack
- Time of the spray
- Date of the spray
- Password(s) attempted
