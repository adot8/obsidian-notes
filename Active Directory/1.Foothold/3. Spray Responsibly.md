This is a key focus for us as it is one of two main avenues for gaining domain credentials for access, but one that we also must proceed with cautiously.

It is worth targeting high-value hosts such as `SQL` or `Microsoft Exchange` servers, as they are more likely to have a highly privileged user logged in or have their credentials persistent in memory.

If we find a desktop host with the local administrator account password set to something unique such as `$desktop%@admin123`, it might be worth attempting `$server%@admin123` against servers. if we find non-standard local administrator accounts such as `bsmith`, we may find that the password is reused for a similarly named domain user account. If we retrieve the password for a user named `ajones`, it is worth trying the same password on their admin account (if the user has one), for example, `ajones_adm`, to see if they are reusing their passwords. This is also common in domain trust situations. We may obtain valid credentials for a user in domain A that are valid for a user with the same or similar username in domain B or vice-versa.

> [!NOTE] Note
> If you find a set of valid credentials, pass it around the entire network to see if it's a local admin anywhere
