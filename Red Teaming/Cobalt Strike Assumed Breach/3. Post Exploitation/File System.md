Interacting with the local file system is one of the most basic forms of enumeration.  The `ls` command, with no arguments, will list the files and directories in the current working directory.

```powershell
beacon> ls
[*] Listing: C:\\

 Size     Type    Last Modified         Name
 ----     ----    -------------         ----
          dir     02/14/2025 13:51:00   $Recycle.Bin
          dir     03/27/2025 14:09:13   $WinREAgent
          dir     02/06/2025 20:39:37   Documents and Settings
          dir     12/07/2019 09:14:52   PerfLogs
          dir     03/24/2025 12:34:54   Program Files
          dir     03/24/2025 12:23:53   Program Files (x86)
          dir     03/24/2025 12:15:24   ProgramData
          dir     02/14/2025 13:40:08   Recovery
          dir     02/06/2025 20:39:45   System Volume Information
          dir     03/27/2025 14:23:12   Users
          dir     03/24/2025 12:15:02   Windows
 8kb      fil     03/27/2025 07:06:27   DumpStack.log.tmp
 1gb      fil     03/27/2025 07:06:27   pagefile.sys
 256mb    fil     03/27/2025 07:06:27   swapfile.sys
```

Providing a path will list the target directory. This can be either an absolute or relative path:

```powershell
beacon> ls C:\Users
[*] Listing: C:\Users\

 Size     Type    Last Modified         Name
 ----     ----    -------------         ----
          dir     12/07/2019 09:30:39   All Users
          dir     03/24/2025 12:22:38   Default
          dir     12/07/2019 09:30:39   Default User
          dir     02/07/2025 14:54:49   pchilds
          dir     02/06/2025 20:41:37   Public
          dir     03/27/2025 14:23:13   rsteel
 174b     fil     12/07/2019 09:12:42   desktop.ini

beacon> ls Users
[*] Listing: Users\

 Size     Type    Last Modified         Name
 ----     ----    -------------         ----
          dir     12/07/2019 09:30:39   All Users
          dir     03/24/2025 12:22:38   Default
          dir     12/07/2019 09:30:39   Default User
          dir     02/07/2025 14:54:49   pchilds
          dir     02/06/2025 20:41:37   Public
          dir     03/27/2025 14:23:13   rsteel
 174b     fil     12/07/2019 09:12:42   desktop.ini
```

The `cd` command will change the working directory of the Beacon which also accepts an absolute or relative path.

> Use the `drives` command to see if a machine has any additional drives.

## File Browser

Another way to interact with the file system is via the File Browser.  This can be accessed with the `file_browser` command or by right-clicking on the Beacon (in the table or graph view) and selecting **Explore > File Browser**.  The first directory it loads will be the current working directory.

Directories that are greyed out have not yet been viewed.  To drill down into a directory, double-click it in the central view, or single-click in the drive view (to the left).  The file browser sends jobs to the Beacon, so you cannot load data faster than its current check-in time.

> The file browser will retain all the data whilst it's open.  If you close the tab, all the data will be forgotten and opening a new file browser tab will not retain the previous data collected.
