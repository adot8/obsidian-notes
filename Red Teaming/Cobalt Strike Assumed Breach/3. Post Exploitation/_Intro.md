The post-exploitation phase is the meat and potatoes of an engagement as this is where the red team would begin hunting down the operational objective.  The team has to locate the objective, figure out who has access to it, and execute a game-plan for gaining access, all without getting caught.  The TTPs required may include local and domain reconnaissance, privilege escalation, credential dumping, user impersonation, and lateral movement.

To facilitate this process, one of the first stages after gaining initial access is to assess the lay of the land, also called 'situational awareness'.  We'd like to find as much information as we can about the machine we currently have access to and the environment that it is part of.  This can include:

- Are there any interesting files, shares, or mapped drives.
- What processes are running.  Are there any interesting or vulnerable software.  
    - AV, EDR, or other defensive products like LAPS or Sysmon.
    - What versions of .NET / PowerShell are present.    
- What user(s) are logged in and what privileges do they have
- Are there any browser bookmarks or saved credentials.
- Local security policies such as UAC hardening, SMB signing, etc.
- What other machines are in the domain.  What services are they running?
    - Which users have access to them?
    

Cobalt Strike provides multiple primitives to ascertain this information, using either built-in or 3rd party tooling.
