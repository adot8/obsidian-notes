There are a few different ways in which Beacon can take screenshots of the target's desktop.

## printscreen

The first is with the `printscreen` command.  This sends a PrintScr keypress to the user's keyboard, which places a copy of the screenshot in their clipboard.  Beacon then pulls the data from the clipboard and sends the output back to the operator.  Use this one sparingly.

```powershell
beacon> help printscreen
Use: printscreen [pid] [x86|x64]
     printscreen

Inject a screenshot tool into the specified process.

Use printscreen with no arguments to spawn a temporary process and inject the 
screenshot tool into it.

Printscreen forces a PrintScr keypress and grabs the screenshot from the
clipboard. It then exits. This command will clear the clipboard contents after
its done.

No long-running variant of this exists because... lets face it... nuking the
clipboard periodically is probably not good OPSEC.
```

## screenshot

The second is with the `screenshot` command.  This uses a post-ex DLL to grab the content of the screen without relying on the clipboard.

```powershell
beacon> help screenshot
Use: screenshot [pid] [x86|x64]
     screenshot

Inject a screenshot tool into the specified process.

Use screenshot with no arguments to spawn a temporary process and inject the 
screenshot tool into it.

Screenshot takes a picture of the visible desktop and exits.
```

> The screenshot command can also be executed by right-clicking a Beacon and selecting **Explorer > Screenshot**; and from the Process Explorer window by selecting a target process and clicking the Screenshot button.

## screenwatch

The `screenwatch` command provides a way to take continuous screenshots automatically.

```powershell
beacon> help screenwatch
Use: screenwatch [pid] <x86|x64>
     screenwatch

Inject a screen watcher tool into the specified process.

Use screenwatch with no arguments to spawn a temporary process and inject the 
screen watch tool into it.

Screenwatch sends a screenshot of the user's desktop (one per Beacon check-in)
until terminated. If the user is idle, the screen watch tool will take a new
screenshot every three minutes.

To terminate this task: use jobs to find the job ID. Use jobkill to kill it.
```

> The frequency of the screenshots is tied to the sleep time of the Beacon.  If you want a screenshot every 5 seconds; run `sleep 5`.  If you want one every minute, `sleep 60`; and so-on.

In all cases, the screenshots are sent to a dedicated tab that can be accessed via **View > Screenshots**.

You can right-click on a row and click **Save** to pull a copy of a screenshot to your local computer, or **Delete** to remove it altogether.  You can also right-click the image itself to change its zoom level.
