There are countless commercial and open source tooling that are useful to leverage during an engagement. Some notable examples include Seatbelt for local reconnaissance, PowerView for domain reconnaissance, Certipy & Certify for ADCS abuse, Rubeus for Kerberos abuse, and Impacket for lateral movement, credential dumping & relaying.  Some tools will need to be executed directly on a target and some can operate over a network.  This lesson will focus on the former.  

Beacon provides means to execute PowerShell scripts, .NET assemblies, and reflective DLLs, all in-memory to give as much flexibility as possible to the operator.
