There are countless commercial and open source tooling that are useful to leverage during an engagement. Some notable examples include Seatbelt for local reconnaissance, PowerView for domain reconnaissance, Certipy & Certify for ADCS abuse, Rubeus for Kerberos abuse, and Impacket for lateral movement, credential dumping & relaying.  Some tools will need to be executed directly on a target and some can operate over a network.  This lesson will focus on the former.  

Beacon provides means to execute PowerShell scripts, .NET assemblies, and reflective DLLs, all in-memory to give as much flexibility as possible to the operator.

## powershell

There are three ways to execute PowerShell in Beacon. The first is with the `powershell` command.

```powershell
beacon> help powershell
Use: powershell [commandlet] [arguments]

Execute the command using powershell. Any cmdlets from the
last use of powershell-import are available here too.
```

This uses powershell.exe which makes it roughly equivalent to the `shell` command (which uses cmd.exe).

```powershell
beacon> powershell $env:computername
LON-WKSTN-1
```

The cmdlet and arguments that you specify are converted into an encoded command before execution.  So the command above is actually executed as: `powershell -nop -exec bypass -EncodedCommand JABlAG4AdgA6AGMAbwBtAHAAdQB0AGUAcgBuAGEAbQBlAA==`.  Operators can modify this behaviour using hooks in Aggressor script.
