Another, admittedly crude technique for impersonating a user, is to inject [[T1055](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/)] Beacon shellcode directly into a process they are running.Â  The new Beacon session that comes back will be running in the address space of this process and therefore under the security context of its owner.

Find a target process using the `ps` command or the process explorer, then inject shellcode for the given listener into it.

```powershell
 PID   PPID  Name                       Arch  Session     User
 ---   ----  ----                       ----  -------     ----
