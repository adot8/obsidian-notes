List running processes with the `ps` command.  The information returned includes the ID of the process (PID), the PID of its parent process, the process architecture (x64 or x86), the session ID, and the user running it.  The output is primarily ordered by PID and then by the PIDs of its children.  For instance, this output shows that registry (88), smss.exe (308), and Memory Compression (2052) are all children of System (4).

> You will not be able to read the arch, session, or user information of processes other than your own, unless your Beacon is running in high-integrity.

## Process Browser

Like the file browser, Cobalt Strike has a process browser, which can be access using the `process_browser` command or **Explore > Process List**.
