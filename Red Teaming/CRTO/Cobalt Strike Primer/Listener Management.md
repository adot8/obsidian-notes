## What is a listener?

The first step in configuring Cobalt Strike is to create one or more listeners.  A listener defines the protocol and parameters by which a Beacon payload will communicate with the team server.  The protocols provided by Cobalt Strike out-of-the-box are DNS, HTTP, HTTPS, SMB, and TCP.  These provide a means of disguising the networking activity generated by a Beacon to look like traffic one would normally expect to see on a corporate network.

## Listener Types

These listeners can also be split into two types.

- ### Egress
    
    As a rule of thumb, an egress Beacon will communicate directly to a team server through the network boundary of the target environment.  DNS and HTTP/S are egress listeners.
    
- ### Peer-to-Peer
    
    A P2P Beacon does not communicate with the team server directly, but has its traffic routed through another Beacon instead.  Multiple P2P Beacons can be chained together, but they will ultimately be linked to an egress Beacon for the traffic to reach the team server.  SMB and TCP are the P2P listeners.
