## Goal planning

Agreeing on engagement goals can be difficult, especially when either yourself or client is new to red teaming.Â  Some points of discussion could include:

- What ability does a threat have to gain physical and/or remote access?
- What ability does a threat have to gain elevated (local and/or domain admin) access?
- What ability does a threat have to move freely throughout a network?
- What ability does a threat have to identify and access sensitive information?
- What ability does a threat have to exfiltrate sensitive data?
- How long can a threat go undetected and what must a threat do to initiate a reaction from the organisation?
- What are the potential business impacts a threat could realise?

These goals should be geared towards assessing the concerns of the client, i.e. what gaps do they have in their protection of their business assets.
