The _payload_ and _decoy_ are arguably the most important parts of your infection chain.  The payload contains the malicious code that will run on the victim's machine; and the decoy is content that you want the user to see after they've interacted with the trigger.  The decoy could be as simple as an image, PDF, spreadsheet, and so on.  There's not much to say about decoys other than that they should continue your social engineering pretext.  For instance, if you've disguised a trigger as a PDF file, then the decoy should also be a PDF document.
