Many initial access campaigns do not package the payload in the container directly, opting to use a 'dropper' instead.  Simply put, a dropper is a program that delivers another program.  The purpose of using a dropper is to evade anti-virus and to complicate the analysis of the infection chain.  Most droppers achieve this by extracting embedded resources from inside their own image, or downloading them over a protocol such as HTTP(S) or DNS.
