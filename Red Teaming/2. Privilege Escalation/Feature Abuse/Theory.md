Features abuse are awesome as there are seldom patches for them and
they are not the focus of security teams!

 One of my favourite features abuse is targeting enterprise applications
which are not built keeping security in mind.

On Windows, many enterprise applications need either Administrative
privileges or `SYSTEM` privileges making them a great avenue for privilege
escalation.
